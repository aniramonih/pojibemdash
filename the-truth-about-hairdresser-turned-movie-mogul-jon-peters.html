(Per <a href=#>Dirt</a>, he put the latter up on the market in 2019 for over $4 million.) "Everybody's reclusive when you make a certain amount of money," he told THR. "Especially if you've had a tough life, you try to fortify yourself with your friends and kind of keep the world out."</p><p dir=ltr>As much success as Peters has achieved, he believes he's been shortchanged to some degree.&nbsp;"I never got credit for producing 100 movies, for running Sony, for coming from the street, becoming the chairman," he added.
