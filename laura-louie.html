Whatsoever, she is a businesswoman by profession as she co-founded a company named <i>Yoganics</i>, which is an organic food delivery service.</p><p>The beautiful wife of Woody, Laura, was born in <i>1965</i>, and she belongs to Asian ethnicity. Further, she holds an American nationality.</p><h2>Laura's Married Life With Woody Harrelson</h2><p>The blissful couple, Laura and Woody, exchanged the wedding vows on <i>28 December 2008</i>. Woody is one of the most A-listed actors in America who rose to fame after portraying the role of <strong>Woody Boyd </strong>on the NBC sitcom, <i>Cheers </i>in <i>1985</i>. Moreover, he is also an accountant of many awards, such as the <i>Academy Award, Primetime Emmy Award</i>, and <i>MTV Movie Award</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/19/8761fb506841d06aa83641e710f26913%20(1)-1574150234177.jpg><p>Even though Woody is a celebrated actor, their wedding ceremony was not so grand. They executed their marriage at their Maui home in front of their close friends, including <strong>Owen Wilson</strong>,<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Bill Murray</strong></a><strong>, Sean Penn, </strong><a href=#><strong>Marlon Wayan</strong></a>, and <strong>Willie Nelson</strong>. Likewise, <strong>Alanis Morissette</strong> was the entertainment provider. Moreover, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>whole expense of their ceremony was just $500</a>.</p><h2>How Did They Meet?</h2><p>Well, Laura met her now-husband, Woody, on the set of the sitcom, <i>Cheers</i>, back in <i>1987</i>. At that time, she worked as his assistant, and later, they fell in love. However, they started dating after two years of their first meeting, which is in <i>1989</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/19/5bb3f3f4200000e800004ee0%20(1)-1574150962137.jpeg><p>After <i>13 </i>years of their successful relationship, Woody was found being in a physical relationship with three women in <i>2002</i>, which broke Laura's heart. But, instead of giving up on him, she chose not to break up with Woody and moved out of the tragedy and married six years later.</p><h2>30 Years Of Togetherness</h2><p>Back in <i>2013</i>, they were seen enjoying their time in New York as the two were holding their hands, smiling, looking at each other face.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/19/article-0-19F226D3000005DC-243_634x735%20(1)-1574150879127.jpg><p>Reportedly, the lovey-dovey <a href=# rel=nofollow>couple was seen on vacation&nbsp;in Italy</a>&nbsp;on Saturday, along with their youngest daughter, <strong>Makani</strong>. They were seen on the streets of Ravello, where Woody was in a blue t-shirt, burgundy shorts, and a money bag around his waist. Similarly, Laura was in red top and white shorts with a handbag.</p><p>It has been <i>30 </i>years of their togetherness, and the couple is living happily without any kind of separation or divorce rumors at all. Further, the couple currently resides in Maui, Hawaii, along with their two adorable dogs and cats. As a matter of fact, the pair is an animal lover, as well as the people who encourage healthy living.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/19/4D5904BD00000578-0-image-a-1_1529260944301%20(1)-1574150779426.jpg><p>Apart from her relationship with Woody, she has not been in any other extra-marital relationship in her past. On the other hand, her husband, Woody, was previously married to the daughter of <strong>Neil Simon</strong>, <strong>Nancy Simon</strong>. They exchanged the oath of husband and wife in <i>1985</i>. However, their marriage turns out to be a failure, and they divorced after ten months.</p><h2>Shares Three Children</h2><p>For now, the couple is enjoying their parenthood as they are parents of their three children. They welcomed their first child, a daughter, <strong>Deni Montana</strong><i> 28 February 1994</i>, and currently, she is <i>25-</i>year-old. Likewise, Laura gave birth to their second daughter, <strong>Zoe Giordano Harrelson</strong>, on <i>22 September 1996</i>, and her age is <i>23-</i>year-old as of <i>2019</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/19/Woody%20Harrelson%20and%20Fans%20(1)-1574151236287.jpg><p>They similarly welcome their third daughter, <strong>Makani Ravello Harrelson</strong>, in <i>June 2006</i>, and currently, she is <i>13-y</i>ear-old. In an interview with&nbsp;HuffPost, he talked about his daughters as he was asked that On What He Wants For His Kids? he replied,</p><p>"It would have been great if I'd been as easy-going as Woody in 'Cheers' ― I loved that show ― but I wasn't. I have taught my daughters to experience life and not be constantly making judgments, which held me back. I am a great example for my daughters for what not to do. But they are strong and tough; they see through falseness. At the same time, they are optimistic and open."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/19/Laura-Louie-4%20(1)-1574151329107.jpg><p>Surely, Laura and Woody must be taking good care and co-parenting them well.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Laura Louie</h2><p>Laura, who is a co-founder of a company, Organics, was an actress in the past.
