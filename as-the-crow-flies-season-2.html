<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>As the Crow Flies Season 2 Release Date, Cast, Countdown, Spoiler &amp;amp; What We Know</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>As the Crow Flies Season 2</strong>: As the Crow Flies is a Turkish drama series that premiered on Netflix on June 4, 2021. The show follows the story of Asli Tuna, a young and ambitious intern who joins a prestigious news channel and becomes obsessed with the veteran anchor, Kerem. As she tries to climb the corporate ladder, she faces various challenges and dilemmas that test her morals and ethics. The show has been praised for its gripping plot, realistic characters, and social commentary.</p><p>The first season of As the Crow Flies ended with a cliffhanger, leaving fans wondering about the fate of Asli and the consequences of her actions. Will she be able to handle the pressure and the spotlight? Will she face the truth and the justice? Will she find happiness and love? These are some of the questions that fans are eager to find out in the second season of the show.</p><p>But when will the second season of As the Crow Flies be released on Netflix? Who will be in the cast? What will happen in the next episodes? Here is everything we know so far about the upcoming season of the Turkish drama.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Release_Date_of_As_the_Crow_Flies_Season_2></span>Release Date of As the Crow Flies Season 2<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of November 18, 2023, Netflix has <strong>not officially renewed</strong> As the Crow Flies for a second season. However, this does not mean that the show is canceled or that there is no hope for a sequel. Netflix usually takes a few months to evaluate the performance and the popularity of a show before making a decision about its renewal. Considering that As the Crow Flies has been a hit in over 30 countries, it is likely that Netflix will give the green light for a second season soon.</p><p>If the show is renewed, the production will depend on several factors, such as the availability of the cast and crew, the COVID-19 situation, and the budget. The first season of As the Crow Flies consisted of eight episodes, each ranging from 41 to 51 minutes. Assuming that the second season will have a similar format and length, it will take at least a year to complete the filming and the post-production.</p><p>Therefore, our best guess is that As the Crow Flies season 2 will premiere on Netflix in <strong>early 2024</strong>, possibly in January or February. Of course, this is just a prediction and not a confirmation, so fans should take it with a grain of salt and wait for the official announcement from Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cast-of-As-the-Crow-Flies-season-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cast of As the Crow Flies season 2 will depend on the fate of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">characters in the first season</a>.
