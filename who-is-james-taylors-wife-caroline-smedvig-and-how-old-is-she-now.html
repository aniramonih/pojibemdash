Her exact place of birth is not known, but she is an American by citizenship. Caroline spent her growing up years in Albany, New York and is of Caucasian ethnic background.</p><p>Apart from her official name, Caroline Smedvig, she is also known by other monikers like Caroline Elisabeth Hessberg or Kim Taylor – a name she assumed after getting married to James Taylor.</p><h3><strong>Who are Caroline Smedvig Parents?</strong></h3><p>Caroline’s parents have been identified as Albert Hessberg II and Elisabeth Fitzsimons Goold. An alum of Yale University, Albert was a popular attorney in Albany, where he served in the law firm popularly known as Hiscock & Barclay; he was one of its senior partners.</p><p>The legal practitioner grew to become the president of the Albany County Bar Association. He also put in years with the Albany Medical Center as a board member. Albert received treatment for his cancer at the same health facility, but unfortunately, he passed on in January 1995 at the age of 78.</p><p>Nothing much is known about her mum, Elisabeth Fitzsimons Goold, but she is also late. The matriarch of the Hessberg family preceded her spouse to the grave as she died four years earlier in 1991.</p><h3><strong>She is not the Only Child of her Parents</strong></h3><p>Caroline Smedvig isn’t the only offspring of the late Albert Hessberg II and his wife, Elisabeth Fitzsimons Goold, as she shared great childhood memories with two brothers – Albert Hessberg III and Philip Hessberg III.</p><p>Like his father, Philip joined the legal profession, but unfortunately, he got disbarred in June 2019 by the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division’s Third Judicial Department. It happened that he was found guilty of some serious crimes, like filing a false tax return, and he also confessed to wire and mail fraud. Philip equally pleaded guilty to stealing funds in excess of $2 million from his clients and firm to pay income taxes, school tuition, and wedding expenses. Thus, he is no longer a member of the bar.</p><p>Albert has remained the lesser known of the two brothers, as nothing about his personal and professional life is known.</p><h3><strong>Caroline Smedvig is a College Graduate</strong></h3><p>Caroline Smedvig went all the way to college. She attended Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, graduating in 1975. However, her course of study has never been disclosed. Many have since concluded that she may have studied journalism or courses that are linked to media work, as she once worked as a journalist.</p><p>Before proceeding to the University, Kim went to high school in her locality. The former reporter was a student at Albany Academy for Girls, where she finished in 1971</p><h2><strong>How did Caroline Smedvig and James Taylor Meet?</strong></h2><p>While she was working with Boston Symphony Orchestra, John Williams conducted a Boston Pops concert at the Hall in 1993, and that was where Caroline Smedvig met James Taylor, who happened to be one of the performing artists.</p><p>However, it was not possible for the duo to commence dating immediately as Taylor was still in his second marriage to Kathryn Walker. Kathryn eventually called it quits with the American musician two years later, affording him the opportunity to go on a first date with Caroline on the 3rd of July 1995. Reports said the date was where Taylor got the inspiration for his hit track, “On the 4th of July.”</p><p>The romantic duo went on to have a relationship that lasted almost six years before they decided to take things a notch higher by tying the nuptial knot.</p><h2><strong>Caroline Smedvig Became James Taylor’s Wife in 2001</strong></h2><p>The 18th of February 2001 will remain a memorable one for Caroline Smedvig and her husband, James Taylor, as that was their wedding date. The couple exchanged wedding vows in the presence of 50 guests comprising family and close friends.</p><p>The couple’s wedding ceremony was hosted in Boston, precisely at the Emmanuel Episcopal Church. It was a beautiful affair, with the bride and groom radiating love and happiness. Both Kim and James were a bit advanced in age as at the time of their nuptials; she was 47 while Taylor’s 52, but that did not stop them from building a happy home.</p><p>Taylor had already made a name for himself in the music industry when he married Caroline, who was working as a staff of BOS.</p><h2><strong>Caroline Swedvig is not James Taylor’s First Wife</strong></h2><p>Far from being the music star’s wife number one, Caroline Swedvig was actually the third. The wife of Taylor’s youth was musician Carly Simon whom he married during the early days of his career in the music industry. During their wedding, which took place in November 1972, James was just 24, and his bride was five years older at 29.</p><p>The couple went on to have a union that lasted 11 years, ending in divorce in 1983. The duo got two children out of their days together – Ben (b. Jan 22, 1977) and Sally (b. Jan 7, 1974) and they both followed in their parent’s footsteps as musicians.</p><p>Barely two years after his divorce from Simon, James walked down the aisle for the second time. This time around, he wedded actress Kathryn Walker, and their nuptials took place on December 14th, 1985, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Though Taylor confessed that Kathryn helped him in getting clean from his heroin addiction, their union also ended after 11 years in 1996.</p><h3><strong>James Was Carolyn’s Second Husband</strong></h3><p>By the time Caroline Smedvig exchanged wedding vows with James in 2001, she had already been through one marriage and divorce. She was the wife of the famed BSO’s former principal trumpeter known as Rolf T. Smedvig. The duo got married in December 1980, following which Caroline took on the name, Smedvig.</p><p>Though Rolf is now dead, his marriage with Caroline did not last long. They only managed to keep it together for a few years before divorcing. After their divorce, the trumpeter was the first to move on with Kelly Holub, who eventually became his next wife.</p><h3><strong>Taylor Speaks about the Secret to their Enduring Relationship</strong></h3><p>Caroline Smedvig and her husband have spent over 22 years and counting in their union, and speaking about their enduring relationship, the “Fire and Rain” hitmaker attributed it all to maturity. Taylor advised men to marry late in life as many of them won’t make good partners till they exceed 35 years of age. Elaborating on his claim, the music superstar said men needed that space to finish experimenting until that hope for someone better or different gets fulfilled.</p><p>Life has been all roses and Champaign for Smedvig and James as the couple’s bond seems to be getting stronger by the day. Though she is not actively involved in a career of her own, the former journalist spends quality time supporting her husband’s flourishing career.</p><p>The duo is frequently spotted on music stages together, and whenever Taylor needs to make a public appearance, Caroline is always by his side. They keep a united front on the red carpet, at events, on special occasions, and even on social media.</p><p>On his own part, James Taylor has contributed a lot to his enduring marriage with Caroline Smedvig. The music crooner has inked some really cool tracks in honor of his love interest. Good examples are Caroline I See You and the hit song titled On the 4th of July. In fact, he worked part of their life together into his October Road album, which dropped in 2002.</p><h2><strong>What Does James Taylor’s Wife Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Caroline Smedvig does not lay claim to fame as a musician, but she is also part of the music industry. In 1980, she landed a plum position at BSO (the Boston Symphony Orchestra) – a well-known orchestra located in Boston.</p><p>During her time there, she worked her way up the ladder to become the company’s Director of Public Relations and Marketing. Smedvig went on to spend the ensuing 24 years in this job before she took the conscious decision to leave in 2004.</p><p>Interesting to note that the former pub relations director of BOS did not leave the entertainment company completely. After she got married to Taylor, the duo put down roots in Lenox, Massachusetts, which made it possible to her to continue contributing to BOS as a trustee, starting in September 2007.</p><p>Caroline Smedvig also works with her musician husband as a backup vocalist for some of his tracks. She always appears alongside their twin sons.</p><h3><strong>She worked as a Journalist Before Joining BOS</strong></h3><p>Caroline was still busy with her undergraduate studies when KKK news or Knickerbocker News employed her as a reporter. From there, she proceeded to the Springfield Daily News – the popular historic afternoon newspaper where she put in some months in the newsroom.</p><h2><strong>Her Husband is a Six-time Grammy Award-winning Artist</strong></h2><p>Far from being a run-of-the-mill kind of musician, James Taylor has written his name on the sands of time in the music industry as a six-time Grammy Award winner. The music hitmaker has also been nominated for several other prestigious awards and has bagged quite a number. A good example is his 2006 World Soundtrack Award which he received for his Best Original Track written for Film for Cars. He is a multitalented artist listed as a vocalist, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist (he plays the guitar and organ).</p><p>At the onset of his music career in 1966, Caroline Swedvig’s spouse joined efforts with Joel O’Brien and Kortchmar to found the music group known as The Flying Machines. The group had one track credit, Brighten Your Night with My Day, which was written by James Taylor, but unfortunately, they didn’t last more than a year, disbanding during the springtime of 1967.</p><p>From then on, Taylor went solo, and as a signee of Warner Bros Records in 1968, he launched his self-titled debut album “James Taylor” in the United Kingdom. Subsequently, he released two additional albums – October Road in 2002 and Covers in 2008. October Road eventually charted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at #4. Some of his best-known tracks include Don’t Talk Now, Round the Zoo, Knocking, and Blues is Just a Bad Dream</p><p>Today, James Taylor is a household name in the music industry who has built an incredible career in the world of showbiz and is listed among the best-selling artists of all time.</p><p>Apart from his music career, Taylor has also dabbled in the acting world. He was part of the cast of the 1971 movie Two-lane Blacktop by Monte Hellman, where he played a leading role.</p><h2><strong>Caroline Smedvig is a Mother of Two</strong></h2><p>Caroline Smedvig obviously didn’t have any kids from her first marriage to Rolf, and by the time she married Taylor at 47, the former BOS employee was desperate to have a child.</p><p>Initially, the music hitmaker didn’t want to have more kids but later changed his mind out of the great love he felt for Caroline. Thus, it was a heartbreaking moment for the couple when Kim was told that she couldn’t carry a child. However, this sad news did not discourage the couple one bit, as they opted for surrogacy immediately.</p><p>Eventually, they convinced one of the singer’s close friends who went through Invitro Fertilization in 2002, though her identity has never been revealed to date. Their unidentified surrogate mother carried the pregnancy full term, and in April 2002, she delivered a set of twin boys – Henry and Rufus.</p><p>The Taylor twins are now in their twenties and are already part of the music industry. Currently, they provide their dad with backup vocals in his performances.</p><p>Talking about parenting in old age, Caroline Smedvig’s husband said it was much better than having kids too early. At this stage, you will be settled and feel ready enough to welcome new members to the family, James said.</p><p>Taylor also revealed that he is not just happy but deeply grateful for where he ended up — his marriage, his family, and his career. The legendary musician described it as “just great.”</p><p>The couple currently resides in Lenox, Massachusetts, where they raised their boys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmaikaKytHnTmrClp6Koeri1xZ5knJmipLmqusRmqqadlKu2qHnAp5tmoJ%2BserC4w2agrGWjnbJuus6wZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-han-ji-min-boyfriend-in-2022-han-ji-min-dating-history-all-you-need-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Han Ji-min Boyfriend In 2022?
