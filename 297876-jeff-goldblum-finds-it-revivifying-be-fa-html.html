She surprised him with a trip to Florence, Italy, for his 70th birthday.

However, when he married her, he knew that he could have children with her.</p><p class=dh>In an interview in 2018, Jeff mentioned that becoming a father at a late age had made him think about his own mortality and where he would be when his children were older. At the time, his children were two years old and ten months old.</p><p class=dh>He said that as an older father, he extrapolated to figure out where he would be and where his children would be as they age. He also mentioned that he knew he wouldn't be around to see all of his children's milestones because of his age.</p><p class=dh>The actor shared that every time he bought a watch, he wondered about which of his children would get the watch when he passed away. However, he knows that becoming a father when he did was perfect for him.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jeff Goldblum is Glad He Waited to Have Children</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>While he acknowledged that becoming a father at a late age was daunting at first and made him question everything he did, he also knew that he was grateful that he had children when he did and that he had them with Emilie.</p><p class=dh>Talking about the experience of becoming a father for the first time at 62, Jeff shared that he enjoyed the experience. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://inews.co.uk/culture/jeff-goldblum-interview-isle-of-dogs-wes-anderson-style-139529>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm glad I waited. It feels great to do it right now because all the things I'm considering are perfectly suited to the big questions and challenges of having kids and what you want to expose them to."</p><p class=dh>He has often talked about how wonderful his wife is with their children and that he is grateful that she became the mother of his children. He spoke of being a father to two young children at age 70 this year.</p><p class=dh>Jeff <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/dads/jeff-goldblum-dad-70-s-revivifying-rcna57688>said</a> that becoming a father so late was "amazing, revivifying, and makes [his] relationship with Emilie, frankly, enhanced." He also described his children as "spectacular" but said it is still a tough job to be a parent.</p><p class=dh>Jeff's children, Charlie and River, are now five and seven years old, and Jeff says it is not an easy age. He said he sometimes felt as though his children were feral and had been let out of a cage.</p><p class=dh>While he recognized that it could be challenging to parent his children, he said it was also a fantastic experience and said the children were great. He also said they were as energetic as him when he was a child.</p><p class=dh>The actor said when he was younger, he had a lot of energy and channeled it into performing.
