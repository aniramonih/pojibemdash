"So, if there was room for my character to somehow feature again then yeah I would… simply because I had such a lovely time working with all the people I worked with - and like I said it would be down to how effective it would be in the show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/29cb5d0da86d-jonathan-wrather-court-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebkNYx34WmN data-wc=9><strong>Jonathan Wrather last appeared on our screens in 2017</strong></p><p id=ecH9uifO0OF_ data-wc=63>Jonathan explained that the harrowing scenes caused an overwhelming reaction, with "an astonishing amount of people" being affected by the storyline. "Actually the response we had was some people watched this and it allowed them to be able to talk about their own issues and experiences to family members who had no idea that they were in those kind of relationships," said Jonathan.</p><p id=enRKH_VCGE3f data-wc=2><strong>&nbsp;READ MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Emmerdale's Claire King reveals she was attacked</a></strong></p><p id=eAmw2qCYQXdY data-wc=81>The actor keeps in touch with real life soap couple Zoe Henry and Jeff Hordley, who play Rhona and Cain Dingle in the show. "I miss the people I work with, especially Zoe and Jeff - we had a lot of fun," he said. "It was a great job to be on, because it was just exciting every day and there were a lot of laughs despite our rather intense storylines. And it is a beautiful place to work as well."</p><p id=emGa-pU1MjDm data-wc=68>In fact, Zoe is set to come and watch Jonathan in his theatre show, as he embarks on a completely new project, playing Lord Henry Wotton in . The play, based on the classic novel, celebrates Wilde's wonderful language and will appeal to audiences old and new, telling the story of a cultured, wealthy and beautiful young man's downfall through moral corruption and seduction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3147796e923c-jonathan-wrather-film-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eKmurBguN5_G data-wc=11><strong>Jonathan plays Lord Henry Worron in The Picture of Dorian Gray</strong></p><p id=e3K8EoSgr8tZ data-wc=131>On how it compares to working in a soap, Jonathan said: "With stage obviously you have an audience - a live experience - different every night, you get immediate audience reaction. There is a different focus and concentration - you play a role and you follow their journey from beginning to end, whereas on TV it's all out of sequence. When people ask me if there is one I prefer - it simply depends on the nature of the project. Although, when you start out wanting to be an actor it is usually because of a school play or a youth theatre and then if you choose to train - you are usually trained on the stage or for stage work - so I guess my roots are in the theatre."</p><p id=eTtn3Oyr8Mmv data-wc=2><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Emmerdale stars' real-life romances – see who found love and married in the Dales</a></strong></p><p id=eBwSUfPtCZfo data-wc=23>The tour will head to Richmond, Horsham, Malvern and end in Crewe on 18 May.
