Of his many achievements, for me the greatest gift he gave us all was his direction of 'Life of Brian'. Perfection.

We have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades.
