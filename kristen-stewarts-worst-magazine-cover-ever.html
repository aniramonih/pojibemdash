But it’s still not hideous. <a href=#>Go Fug Yourself</a> jokes that Kristen’s legal team should consider a lawsuit. Kristen probably thinks it’s high-fashion. Maybe it is.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I mentioned that I thought Robert Pattinson was handling his fame a lot better with the Eclipse promotional tour. I haven’t been prepared to say the same about Kristen, what with her constant hyperbolic flubs and, you know, magazine covers like this. However, Kristen thinks she’s doing really well. Really:</p><p>“I am much better at this kind of stuff than I was before,’ Kristen says as we catch up to talk about Eclipse, the third instalment in the Twilight movie franchise. ‘I used to be really uncomfortable. I mean, who wants to talk about themselves all day?”</p><p>Some might suggest that Hollywood A-listers love talking about themselves all day but Stewart is not your typical Tinseltown starlet. In person she is bright and articulate. “You talk all day,’ she says, ‘and you don’t have different answers to the same questions. It becomes tiring. You do your job, why should you then have to talk about your personal life?” she wonders. “I find that a bit weird.”</p><p>She might find life in the media spotlight ‘a bit weird’, then, but Stewart is very much at home on screen. She took her first acting job at just nine years of age and by the time she was 11 she’d already shot 2002’s Panic Room with Jodie Foster.</p><p>“Starting young was never a problem,” she says. “I didn’t really enjoy all the bitchiness at school. I guess I have always felt older than I am. I felt that I should have been an adult at age five. I thought I was an adult when I was 12.”</p><p>“I just think that Bella is written very well and she matures gradually,” she<br>says, deflecting the conversation. “I think Bella resonates with people because she is extremely well written, and while she goes through very simple emotions, they are always very extreme and very sensory. It’s not like she is ever very confused; she just fully inhabits whatever emotion she is feeling. She is so dire all the time!”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Metro UK</a>]</p><p>I think Kristen’s maturity is hit-or-miss, honestly. Yes, she seems to have the confidence of a girl who doesn’t need her peers’ approval. However, I do think she still has moments where she just comes across as even younger than her 20 years, where she seems very bratty and insolent. Is her attitude improving through the years? Eh. Not really.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view1.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9251765/twilight-eclipse-hits-nyc/twilight-eclipse-hits-nyc.jpg border=0 width=500 title="Twilight Eclipse Hits NYC" height=688 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Cast members and celebrity fans alike flock to the screening of the Twilight Saga: Eclipse at the Crosby Hotel in NYC, NY on June 28, 2010.
