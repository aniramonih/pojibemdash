Each lunch would be chicken breast, full potato and some broccoli and I’d have two of those,” the actor said during an interview on the Joe YouTube channel. “And then I remember there’ll be another snack after that,” he For dinner, specifically, it was 20 ounces of certain fish or steak.”</p><p>While he added that he didn’t enjoy eating so much, the moment has helped him go viral on TikTok following the movie’s May release.</p><p>“Feeling the love for Rooster and #TopGunMaverick.

It is one of the greatest movies of all time. I am so excited to show the world this,” Powell <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly in August 2020</a>. “What makes me feel so good about it is that when you know you have the goods, there’s no need to rush it. … Tom and I talked after I watched it, and I told him! I was like, ‘I literally have no more fingernails left. I’ve chewed off all of my fingernails.’ … You cry, you laugh. It’s got adventure. It’s got romance. It’s just like one of those movies, where you’re like, ‘Oh, God, why can’t all movies be this fun and great?’ It’s so rare.”</p><p>Scroll through for the best behind-the-scenes photos:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BpvLF5xq6lZqWRq7KztcKkZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5Oau6a%2FjKmfqKyfqHqwsoymoKWdo2LBprjLnqlmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-15-most-corrupt-african-countries.html><span>←</span><span>Top 15 Most Corrupt African Countries</span></a>
