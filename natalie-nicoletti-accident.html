Kivlehan, 26, of Palos Heights, Illinois, and Natalie S. Nicoletti, 24, of Countryside, Illinois, lost their lives in a fatal wreck that occurred just three miles east of Cle Elum.</strong> The incident, which took place on a Monday afternoon, serves as a grim reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of road safety.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Natalie_Nicoletti_Accident_Details_of_the_Incident></span>Natalie Nicoletti Accident: Details of the Incident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The incident unfolded on a fateful Monday afternoon, shortly after 2:30 p.m. The 2013 Subaru Legacy, in which Kivlehan and Nicoletti were passengers, veered off the road and careened into a ditch on westbound I-90, just west of Milepost 89. The Washington State Patrol swiftly responded to the scene to initiate investigations into the causes and factors contributing to the accident.</p><p>Tragically, both <strong>Kivlehan and Nicoletti lost their lives as a result of the crash. Kivlehan, who was pronounced dead at the scene, hailed from Palos Heights, while Nicoletti, who passed away while being transported to Harborview Medical Center, was from Countryside. </strong>The Kittitas County Coroner’s Office took the responsibility of notifying Kivlehan’s next of kin, while the Countryside Police Department reached out to Nicoletti’s family.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The Subaru’s driver, whose identity was not disclosed by the State Patrol, sustained injuries that necessitated airlifting to Harborview Medical Center for urgent medical attention. <strong>Additionally, a third passenger, a 21-year-old woman from Chicago, Illinois, also suffered injuries and was taken to Harborview for medical treatment.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Accident_Reconstruction></span>Accident Reconstruction<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>According to preliminary information released by the State Patrol, the 2013 Subaru Legacy was traveling in the westbound left lane on Interstate 90. As the highway curved to the left, the sedan unexpectedly veered into the right lane before ultimately leaving the road. The car continued its trajectory for several hundred feet before ultimately ending up in a ditch.</strong> The specifics of what caused the vehicle to veer off the road are central to the ongoing investigation.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Chris Martin Died: Know His Cause of Death?</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Investigation_and_Pending_Charges></span>Investigation and Pending Charges<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The circumstances leading to the accident are currently under investigation by the Washington State Patrol.
