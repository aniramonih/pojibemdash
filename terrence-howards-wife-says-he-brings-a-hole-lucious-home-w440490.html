You try to figure out how you’re going to play him and you’re not really ready to talk about him,” he said. “Now I feel more comfortable about him.”</p><p>When Rancic asked him to share more about his character, Howard’s answer was bleeped out when he replied, “He’s an a–hole.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/591641564_terrence-howard-taraji-p-henson-trai-byers-bryshere-gray-jussie-smollett-empire-zoom-79a5b596-de68-4c0c-b86d-da17daa515bd.jpg><p>The <i>E! News</i> host then asked Pak, “Does he bring his character home with him?” to which Pak responded with a laugh: “He does, quite often, actually.”</p><p>Social media users were quick to bring up past <a href=#>domestic abuse allegations</a> against Howard after Pak’s comment. “VERRRY awkward hearing noted domestic abuser Terrence Howard’s wife say he brings his Empire character ‘home with him often,’” one tweeter wrote, while another added, “That awkward moment when Terrence Howard’s wife says he brings his character home with him and no one knows what to say for a second.”</p><p>He briefly addressed the allegations in a <i><a href=#>Rolling Stone</a></i> interview in 2015, particularly an altercation with his first wife, Lori McCommas, in 2001. “She was talking to me real strong, and I lost my mind and slapped her in front of the kids,” he said. “Her lawyer said it was a closed fist, but even slapping her was wrong.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>On a lighter note, Howard discussed with Rancic why the couple chose the name Hero for their son, who they welcomed last month. “You get two gifts in the world. You get from your parents, life, the first one, and a name, which is the second one. The second one lasts longer than the first,” he said. “We should take the time to give our children a name that they can live up to, you know? So that’s why we chose Hero.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Pak is Howard’s third wife, and they also share <a href=#>son Qirin</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKueqqKau6SxjKGmsJmimcBuw8ifnGarka7AbrTEZpmroZ6cwG6tjKGmpZ1docKktc6uqmagn6KybsOTbWdtcWBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tego-calderon-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-family-facts-and-more-2.html><span>←</span><span>Tego Calderon Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Family, Facts and More</span></a>
