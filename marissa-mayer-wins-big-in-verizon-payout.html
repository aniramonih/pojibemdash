But, for the rich and powerful, being fired from a high-ranking position can prove to be more lucrative than actually keeping it.</p><p>Many were shocked that, if Mayer was terminated from her position within the year, she would receive an incredible severance package from Yahoo worth $55 million. According to the regulatory filing that disclosed this information back in April, Mayer's payout would consist of $3 million in cash, $26,324 in health benefits, and $15,000 for out placement. The rest of the the $52 comes from accelerated restricted stock and options.</p><p>Since Verizon recently purchased Yahoo's core business for $4.83 billion in cash, Mayer's termination, and her big payout, is likely to happen very soon. However, reports are suggesting that Mayer could receive nearly double of the originally estimated $55 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-201617 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-450633377.jpg alt="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-201617 class=wp-caption-text>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p><p>A senior editor for <i>Fortune</i> magazine, Stephen Gandel, and Compensation consultant Brian Foley, calculated that the figure Mayer is likely to walk away with will be, in actuality, closer to a truly astounding $123 million.</p><p>In addition to the $55 million from her severance package, Mayer will still collect her annual $1 million salary, and, if she sells her 1.3 million shares, could pocket $53 million on top of that. It has also come to light that Yahoo will pay Mayer $15,000 a month for two years as a part to ease her transition between being ousted from Yahoo and finding a new job.</p><p>However, it should be noted that shortly after Gandel and Foley's estimates were published, a Yahoo spokesman released a statement calling the $123 million estimate "grossly misleading" and "inaccurate."</p><p>Despite whatever the true payout amount turns out to be, one thing is certain, no one benefits from losing their job quite so much like the mega rich.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfoq6ztdKsmGalka6ys3nWoqWsZZKetG61zWatnqqZr7yvec%2BasKitpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maggie-james-takeru-kobayashi-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Maggie James Is Not Just Takeru Kobayashis Wife But Also His Manager And Translator</span></a>
