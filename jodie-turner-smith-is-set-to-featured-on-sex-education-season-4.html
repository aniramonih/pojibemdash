Turner’s inclusion in Smith’s comes as welcome news to fans in the midst of the show’s cast turmoil. While neither the streaming service nor the show’s creators have confirmed the news, the actress hinted at her involvement in the show at the 2017 BAFTA Film Awards.</p><h2>Because of Ncuti Gatwa, Jodie Turner-Smith was cast in Sex Education</h2><p>While attending the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, February 19, 2023, in London, the actress revealed details about her role in the popular show.</p><p>Jodie Turner-Smith claims:</p><p><strong>“You might catch me on Netflix in a show called Sex Education.”</strong></p><p>When asked how it happened, she stated that the decision was driven by Ncuti Gatwa. Without giving too much away about her character, the actress revealed that she would be linked to Gatwa’s Eric.</p><p>Variety reports that the 36-year-old English actor added:</p><p><strong>“First and foremost, I spent all of my time with Ncuti Gatwa, who I DIE for and who is my favorite character on the show…</strong></p><p>So, when he called and asked me to do it, I said, “I don’t care how much they pay; I’m doing it.”</p><p>Her character, according to reports, will be Eric’s cousin and will be stationed in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, or Ghana. Turner-Smith is not the only new addition to the cast.

The streamer has not yet announced a release date for the fourth season, but it is expected to arrive in mid-2023. Season 4 of the fan-favorite series will “feature a blend of old and new interesting faces,” according to Variety.</p><p>In addition, graduates of Moordale Secondary School will seek “an alternate location to learn – and romp – after the school lost financing and was sold to developers.”</p><p>Turner-Smith will also appear in two television shows, Bad Monkey and The Acolyte, in addition to Sex Education.
