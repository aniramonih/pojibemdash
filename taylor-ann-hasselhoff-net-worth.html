Hasselhoff joined the cast in 2015 for Season 3. She&nbsp;was born on May 5, 1990 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Taylor-Ann Janice Hasselhoff. Before fully committing to working in the entertainment industry, she attended the University of Arizona for two years and&nbsp;majored in communications.</p><p>She admits that she did not expect to make anything of the degree, and mostly went to college for the experience. In addition to her career as a model, she has also appeared in the television shows like&nbsp;Meet the Hasselhoffs, The Hoff: When Scott Came to Stay,&nbsp;and <a href=# title="Chris Moyles Net Worth">Chris Moyles</a> Quiz Night;&nbsp;all of which aired in 2009. She is the president and host of Bellus Magazine, has dabbled in the music industry, and has also done a little producing and directing.&nbsp;When she is not hosting the Bellus Magazine show or filming, she&nbsp;helps take care of what she affectionately calls "her own mini-farm," which is pretty much all of her family's animals. She also&nbsp;devotes a portion of her time to helping those less fortunate than herself through charities like Wheels for Humanity, an organization that increases mobility to children, teens and adults with physical disabilities in developing countries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZMGixcuoqWaZnqN6qa3SrJyloJ%2Bbs266xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tammi-menendez-bio-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tammi Menendez Bio, Net Worth &amp;amp; Everything You Need To Know</span></a>
