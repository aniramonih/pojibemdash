Sadly, Luchasaurus may be a bit more banged up than he wanted to be as he goes into that huge match against Adam Copeland on AEW Dynamite’s Title Tuesday.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of AEW Collision this week</a>.</p><p>During Saturday’s AEW Collision, Adam Copeland had a promo segment at the show’s conclusion. Copeland expressed his confusion over Christian’s rejection on Dynamite because they were supposed to team up again in AEW. He had noticed that Cage had become distant and stopped answering his calls, but he hadn’t given it much thought at the time. Now, he realizes it should have been a clue about what would happen on Wednesday.</p><p>Christian Cage appeared and promised to provide answers on Title Tuesday, but the question remains whether Adam will be able to make it there. Luchasaurus and Nick Wayne entered the ring to attack him, but Darby Allin came to his rescue, only to be subsequently attacked with a ConChairTo to his arm.</p><p>During <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer discussed the segment that went down on AEW Collision this week. They were pulling from the old favorites with a ConChairTo angle.</p><p>“They do a ConChairTo on Darby Allin’s arm and Darby’s arm also, he had a brace on his arm, so it felt like this might be an injury angle for Darby, but that was pretty much it.”</p><p>Bryan Alvarez then chimed in to say, “I think Luchasaurus might have broken his finger during this segment. So, add that to the list.” This is not something that Luchasaurus needs right now, especially at a time when there are already so many injuries on the AEW roster.</p><p>Keep checking back with us here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more updates on this story, and so many more. Adam Copeland vs Luchasaurus is still happening, but the wrestling dinosaur might need to be careful with one of his hands during the match.</p><p>We will have complete coverage of all AEW programming, including AEW Dynamite, Rampage, Collision, and every pay-per-view event with ongoing coverage in&nbsp;<a href=#>our live results section</a>.
