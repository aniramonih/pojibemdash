He was talking in his sleep, saying we got to get out of here,” she told the paper, adding that she plans to take her son to a therapist.</p><p>Gregory said she found out about the shooting when a neighbor asked her if she saw a report on TV.</p><p>“What school?” she said she asked. “‘Your son’s school. They said it was the first grade,’” the neighbor told her, she said.</p><p>“My heart instantly dropped,” Gregory said.</p><p>When she arrived, police said no kids had been hurt.</p><p>“Not physically, but this is going to scar him mentally,” she said she thought.</p><p>When she was finally reunited with her son, she said “you could tell on his face what he was going through.

There’s no way a 6-year-old would meet that criteria,” he added.</p><p>But Block noted that an adult could face misdemeanor charges if the pistol came from a home where the child lives because under state law, guns must be secured from kids under 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmaXFflq%2BjxYyzrp6qnpq%2Fbr%2FHqKtmmqlig27FxJqpZqecmXqiv4ysn55lpKe2prCMraZmm5%2Bjs6q%2FwpqrnmWXqrtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeans-with-stretch-and-structure-shop-now.html><span>←</span><span>17 Stretchy Jeans That Look Like Structured Denim</span></a>
