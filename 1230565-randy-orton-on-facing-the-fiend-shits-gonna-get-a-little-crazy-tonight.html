But I think it’ll be interesting. I don’t know what to expect, and I think that might be a good thing too, for the fans, because you just never know what you’re gonna get.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s on the table. I know that s—‘s gonna get a little crazy tonight. And hopefully, it all ends up being in my favor. We’ve done some crazy stuff the last few months. I set that man on fire and he’s back, so he’s gonna he looking for retribution. And I’m gonna be there, and I’m gonna take it like a man, and hopefully be able to deliver it, give it right back to him tenfold.”</p><p>Orton also explained that he believes his match with The Fiend will be the most memorable part of WWE WrestleMania 37 Night Two.</p><p>“Something crazy’s gonna happen out there,” said Orton. “And I think that when people talk about this WrestleMania, especially day two of this WrestleMania, the Fiend vs. Orton is gonna be at the top of their list, when it comes to what they remember and the moments that they remember enjoying the most.”</p><p>Orton went on to praise Bad Bunny after the GRAMMY Award winner’s remarkable in-ring debut at WWE WrestleMania 37 Night One. Orton stated that Bad Bunny is officially a WWE Superstar after his performance.</p><p>“We’ve had a lot of celebrities over the years since I’ve been here come in and try to step into our world and do what we do,” said Orton. “For the first time, and maybe not the first time, but for the first time in this manner, I can say that seeing Bad Bunny come into our world, seeing him completely halt his touring schedule, his music, any kind of thing he had going on, he stopped it dead in its tracks so he could get in the ring.</p><p>“I’ve seen him in there, with trainers, trying to get as good as he can get. Two, three, four, five hours a day. That impresses me, and I gotta say thank you to Bad Bunny for having respect for what I do, and for what everyone else in the locker room does, and what WWE does. I appreciate him as a fan, but now I can look over at him and call him a fellow performer in my world.”</p><p>“The Viper” complimented Bad Bunny and explained that he impressed a lot of people with his match on Saturday.</p><p>“I appreciate Bad Bunny and the hard work that he’s put into delivering last night and he did,” said Orton. “He delivered. He knocked everyone’s socks off back here. I was watching and I know that he impressed a lot of his fellow WWE Superstars. He’s officially a WWE Superstar now in my book.”</p><p>The full episode is available here:</p><p></p><p>At WWE WrestleMania 37 Night Two Post-Show, Randy Orton defeated The Fiend with a little help from Alexa Bliss, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn stole the show, and three of WWE’s best stars battled in the main event.<br>How did Sunday’s show conclude “The Showcase of the Immortals”?<br>We break it down with Colin Tessier, Bill Pritchard, and Dominic DeAngelo.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFsZ25uZWK%2ForrDsmSoqqSku267zWadmpuZo7RuwMeeZJ%2BhlaOxbr%2FHoqusZZeku6%2BtjKCcrWWRYrmqwNOlnGabopbHunnTqKWin5ip</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pamela-anderson-being-wooed-by-billionaire-newspaper-magnate.html><span>←</span><span>Pamela Anderson Being Wooed By Billionaire Newspaper Magnate</span></a>
