<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Britney Spears Gets Handsy With Cade Hudson During Birthday Dance</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Pop star <strong>Britney Spears</strong> celebrated her birthday with her longtime friend and manager, <strong>Cade Hudson</strong>, with a party at his house.</p><p>The “Toxic” singer turned 42 on Saturday, December 2, but the festivities began on Friday night, with even her mother, <strong>Lynne Spears</strong>, and her older brother, <strong>Bryan Spears</strong>, in attendance.</p><h2>Britney Spears Gets Handsy Dancing With A Shirtless Cade Hudson At Her Birthday Party</h2><p>On Saturday afternoon, the “Girl In The Mirror” singer posted a video that featured her getting handsy with Cade as the two danced together at her birthday party. She seemingly thought better of posting the video and then decided to delete it.</p><p>However, the video appeared back on Instagram on Saturday night with a longer caption than the few emojis that she had placed there before. “3 days ago I put my favorite green party dress on and actually did my hair for an early B day ….” She wrote in the caption, adding, “Before I wore Cade’s converse in the middle of the night to save my dog.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/10/11042631/Britney-Spears-with-dog-Snow.png><p>As The Blast previously reported, Britney actually had to leave her birthday party with Cade and Bryan and rush her dog, Snow, to a 24-hour vet clinic for something that was wrong with her paw.</p><p>Fortunately, in a follow-up Instagram post on Saturday night, Britney assured her fans that Snow was fine.&nbsp;“Also don’t worry about Snow she’s fine … I went to the emergency vet in the middle of the night with Cade’s shoes and clothes in a hurry,” she wrote, jokingly adding, “I literally look like the girl in All Dogs Go To Heaven dressed up like a man being told to place bets !!!”</p><h2>Britney’s Birthday Party Was A ‘Really Nice Moment’ For The Family</h2><p>Fortunately, it looks like the birthday party helped to thaw the icy relationship between Britney’s mother and brother. Four days ago, the Princess of Pop had taken to Instagram to share a photo of her brother dressed in a green suit with a construction hat on.</p><p>“My big brother who’s like a dad and my best friend !! Not sure what’s going on with this outfit though ????? !!!” she wrote in the caption. She made sure that she disabled comments on this post, as she has done for many of her recent photos and videos.</p><p>“Being together and celebrating her birthday was a really nice moment for the family,” a source told People magazine, noting that her father, <strong>Jamie Spears</strong>, and her sister, <strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong>, were not in attendance.</p><h2>Britney Spears Says ‘Time Heals All Wounds’ When It Comes To Her Estranged Family</h2><p>On May 25, Britney shared a throwback photo of her dressed as a ballerina to Instagram. In the caption, she confirmed that her mother had made the trip from Louisiana to L.A. in order to visit her for the first time in three years.</p><p>“My sweet mama showed up at my door step yesterday after 3 years … it’s been such a long time … with family there’s always things that need to be worked out … but time heals all wounds !!!” Britney wrote at the time. “And after being able to communicate what I’ve held in for an extremely long time, I feel so blessed we were able to try to make things RIGHT !!! I love you so much !!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/11/Britney-Spears-Mother-Lynne-Spears-Arrives-For-Thankgiving-scaled.jpg><p>“Psss… I’m so blessed we can have coffee together after 14 years !!! Let’s go shopping afterwards !!!” she added. Britney has frequently mentioned in her past Instagram posts that she was not allowed to drink coffee during her controversial 13-year conservatorship, which lasted from February 2008 to November 2021.</p><p>That being said, it looks like there are still things that need to be resolved between the two of them. In Britney’s memoir, “The Woman In Me,” she claimed that her mother had thrown out several of her valuable items, including a priceless doll collection and old journals. After Lynne took to Instagram to show that she had some of the dolls and journals that Britney mentioned in her memoir, Britney responded to her mother on Instagram, calling her comments “messed up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqe2tbrEsmSsqJWWv7R5xp6rrGWYlrulv9hmrqKsmGKworDEZp%2BunKOku26w1Kugp59dl7azwMedmLJllJa7pLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./title-boosie-badazz-denies-killing-duke-the-jeweler.html><span>←</span><span>Boosie Badazz Denies Behind Behind Murder Of Chicago Jeweler</span></a>
