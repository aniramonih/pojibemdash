Her first role was in a film directed by her father, Bruce Paltrow, who’s best known for producing shows like&nbsp;St. Elsewhere. Her mother, Blythe Danner, introduced her to the theater. Danner is famous for roles in&nbsp;Will & Grace&nbsp;and&nbsp;Meet the Parents.</p><p id=par-3_49>Even with the boost from her parents’ success, few could have predicted how fast Paltrow’s star would rise. She broke out as the star of ’90s films like&nbsp;Emma,&nbsp;Sliding Doors, and&nbsp;Shakespeare in Love, earning an Oscar for the last one. Paltrow later joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Pepper Potts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-has-two-children-with-ex-husband-chris-martin><strong>She has two children with ex-husband Chris Martin</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gwyneth-paltrow-kids.jpg><p id=par-4_44>Like many A-list actors, Paltrow’s been in a handful of highly publicized celebrity relationships. She was <a href=#>engaged to Brad Pitt</a> before he married Jennifer Aniston, and she dated Ben Affleck before his Bennifer days. However, her longest relationship was with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.</p><p id=par-5_44>After meeting in 2002, Paltrow and Martin married in December 2003. Their daughter, Apple Martin, was born in May 2004. Almost two years later, their son, Moses Martin, followed. After more than a decade together, Martin and Paltrow announced their split, divorcing in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paltrow-and-martin-released-a-product-together><strong>Paltrow and Martin released a product together</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_47>After moving away from acting when she became a mom, Paltrow shifted her focus. She’s now perhaps better known for her <a href=#>lifestyle brand Goop</a> and its affiliated products than her film and TV roles. And, in 2021, she partnered with a familiar face for her latest launch.</p><p id=par-7_45>On the Goop TikTok channel, the pair released a video in which Martin lovingly roasts her mom’s morning routine, commenting on everything from what she eats to the company’s more “out-there” products. The funny clip is actually an ad for their new Goopglow Glow Lotion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-apple-martin-an-actor><strong>Is Apple Martin an actor?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-8_57>Despite working on a TikTok video, it doesn’t appear as though 16-year-old Martin has been bitten by the acting bug like her mom — at least, not yet. It wouldn’t surprise many to see her follow her parents into entertainment in the years to come. But for now, she leads a life out of the public eye.</p><p id=par-9_53>“It’s weird, because we’re famous people, but I think our values are primarily family-oriented,” Paltrow told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Housekeeping</a>&nbsp;in 2011. “We’re not swept up in the whole thing of it.” In the interview, she also spoke about how “work is really fun for” her, something she hoped to teach her children to enjoy as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0uMXNnquhZaCWubW%2BzrBknZmlnLW1sdFmmKmonJp6rq3RraCnZZGYwbC%2BjaGrpqRf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./finn-cole.html><span>←</span><span>Is Finn Cole From Peaky Blinders Dating Someone?
