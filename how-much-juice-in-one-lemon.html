That equals about <b>4 to 5 tablespoons</b> per lemon. To get the maximum amount of liquid from the fruit, microwave the lemon for 10 seconds before cutting and squeezing.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-juice-do-you-get-from-1-medium-lemon></span>How much juice do you get from 1 medium lemon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In order to figure out how much juice and zest are in a lemon we used medium lemons weighing about 3.6 ounces for our test sample. There are 4 to 5 lemons in 1 pound. On average, one lemon has <b>2 tablespoons of lemon juice</b> in it. One lemon also has 1 tablespoon of lemon zest in it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-substitute-fresh-lemon-juice-for-bottled></span>Can I substitute fresh lemon juice for bottled?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Some recipes call for the juice of one lemon, rather than a standard measure. So bear in mind that the average medium-size lemon contains 2‒3 tablespoons of juice and measure accordingly (use the same amount of <b>bottled juice</b> as you would if using fresh).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-the-juice-of-2-lemons></span>How much is the juice of 2 lemons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Half a lemon will yield about <b>1 1/2 tablespoons</b>, the average juice of one lemon equals 3 tablespoons.<br>…<br>Measurements for Lemon Juice Equivalent:<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>Number of Lemons</th><th>Yield</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>2 Lemons Equal</td><td><b>6 Tablespoons</b></td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>3 Lemons Equal</td><td>9 Tablespoons or 1/2 cup</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>4 Lemons Equal</td><td>12 Tablespoons</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>5 Lemons Equal</td><td>15 Tablespoons or 1 cup</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-the-zest-of-one-lemon></span>How much is the zest of one lemon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>One medium-sized lemon will yield <b>roughly 1 tablespoon of zest</b>.
