I’m Emma Shafer, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. May the departed rest in peace. I will never forget the times that you took my phone in order to take a picture with it, the times that you supported me in causing an endless amount of disruption in band class, and the times that you, in general, were nothing but kind to me throughout the entirety of the time that we were friends.</p><p>Those moments will remain ingrained in my memory forever. Those times will always be seared into my memory and I will never forget them. Those things will be permanently etched in my consciousness for the rest of my life, and I will never forget them. I would want to use this opportunity to thank you for the unwavering support you have provided me with and to let you know how much I will miss having you as a part of my life.</p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to let you know how much I will miss having you as a part of my life. In addition, I want you to know how much I treasure the time we spent together and how much it will mean to me to no longer have you as a part of my life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwscymmGarmJazp7HRZpqaql2WsKS1w56lrWWjpb%2BqusafoJ6klGK2rXnLnpivnaNifm6wxJqbaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-threlkeld.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Threlkeld Biography</span></a>
