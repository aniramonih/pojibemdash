Kelly seems to be doing quite well behind bars. The singer successfully petitioned the court to have himself removed from solitary confinement, and has reportedly been doing well mixing with the prison’s general population.</p><p>And recently, Kelly seems to be having some odd itches that he wants to fix — he is dissatisfied with the fact that he cannot see both of his girlfriends at the same time during his jail visitations.</p><p>Kelly’s live-in girlfriends, Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, have stood by him during the scandals.</p><p>Like Hugh Hefner, it is no secret to the world that Kelly is a fan of being in multiple relationships simultaneously, and it does not seem like his current partners mind the situation all too much either and despite all his legal troubles — he seems determined never to change that.</p><p>However, Kelly is quite disappointed with the fact that the system does not allow him to see both of his girlfriends at once, and has been complaining to the court about that for some time now.</p><p>Many of the singer’s fans have pointed out how ridiculous his claims are in the overall context of things, but it does not seem like he minds the negative attention right now in any way.</p><p>Entirely, on the contrary, Kelly has been moving forward with his life very well recently, and he is apparently completely unaffected by the negativity that has been surrounding him in the press for some time.</p><p>Whether the R&B singer will manage to maintain this status quo in the future remains to be seen, but he certainly does not seem to mind the negative press at the moment.</p><p>Kelly was denied bail Wednesday, and his trial date has been set for May 18, 2020.</p><p>One fan had this reaction: “Yes, he’s innocent until proven guilty, and I know you don’t want to believe your music hero is guilty but, you can tell by the discovery and letter that was released yesterday by the DA that they have solid evidence of a pattern of criminal behavior for 20 years. The mountain of evidence in his 4 cases includes texts, financial records, video, surveillance, receipts, numerous witness accounts to back up each indictment. It’s not just girls accusing him, and the witnesses are his own managers, associates, bus driver, stylist, etc.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kelly is used to bad headlines.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeiYrimuMuyZJynnpu2s7nSZquhnV2ku6Z5x5qZoqxdnbJuw8ilo2amlauys3nCoZinn5Visaa%2Fz6KrnmWSmravs4yipKmqmai8r7HDZpinnF2drre1zaBkmmWdpMKvwMCipWanlmK5prPApWSpqp%2BXuaa50mZqa25nbIFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./question-about-jagger-and-gh-history.html><span>←</span><span>Question about Jagger and GH history... - General Hospital</span></a>
