Sadly, the tragedy did not end there. The following year, Caroline married Stefano Casiraghi, an Italian racing driver, per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. In 1990, just eight years after her mom's death, Caroline also lost her husband. And like her mom, he died in a horrific accident.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>During a race near Monaco, his speedboat became engulfed by a wave and turned over. While his co-pilot, Patrice Innocenti, survived the accident, Casiraghi succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital (in a devastating irony, he was rushed to the Princess Grace Hospital). He was 30. "He surely didn't have time to look out and, at that speed, stuck under the boat, must have been killed by the blow," witness and fellow competitor, Michel Karsten, said of his cause of death, per the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>The Royal Observer</a>, theories began circulating that Casiraghi's death was not an accident and he was in fact murdered. Casiraghi's friend, Giancarlo Miorin, claimed that he told him he feared for his life. "He was a frightened man," he said. "He told me: 'Quite frankly, I'm scared. Someone is out to get me.' ... A week later, he was dead." It's been suggested that his business dealings may have played a part in his death, but there's little evidence to back up this theory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamllbn9xgI6rprKZnKh6urvUZqSin5ipeq%2B702aip6enYrGqscNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./football-piers-morgan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Piers Morgans Net Worth: How Rich is the British Journalist?</span></a>
