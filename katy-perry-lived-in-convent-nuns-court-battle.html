But fans of the singer, 39, may not know that she once almost lived in a very unusual place, a far cry from the $32 million glamorous homes she is raising <a class=hm-link href=#>daughter Daisy&nbsp;</a>in with partner <a class=hm-link href=#>Orlando Bloom.</a></p><p id=eSfjnV6FglB data-wc=73>The <a class=hm-link href=#>American Idol&nbsp;</a>judge struck a deal in 2014 with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to buy an eight-and-a-half-acre property for $14.5 million. It is not surprising the plot caught the eye of the 'I Kissed a Girl' singer. The property found on Waverly Drive was originally a canvas for Hollywood set designer Harold Grieve in the 1920s. The space was stunning – grand, with a beautiful stone sweeping staircase and high ceilings.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Miranda Kirr talks relationship with her son's stepmother Katy Perry</figure><p id=ek_Ow0hTYju data-wc=32>The issue that befell the chart-topping singer stemmed from 1971 when the Waverly house was gifted to an order of Catholic nuns known as the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4b38a35aad09-nuns-katy-perry-convent.jpg><p id=ezCRYn3qAKt data-wc=50>This meant that when the singer tried to purchase the opulent residence in 2014, she found she had a bitter legal battle on her hands – with the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary via businesswoman Dana Hollister who incited several of the nuns to make an opposing deal.</p><p id=e0tev_QQG9DW data-wc=65>The crux of the issue the mother-of-one faced lay in whether the court thought the Archdiocese held the authority to sell the property. In the bitter court battle, it was reported by Sky News that Katy was told by one of the nuns that she had <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>"blood on her hands"</a> for depriving them of the Waverly home as it was being used as a convent.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Katy Perry turns heads in a graphic bodycon dress and knee-high sparkly boots" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/630f787a770f-gettyimages-1240077592.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Katy Perry turns heads in a graphic bodycon dress and knee-high sparkly boots" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Katy Perry turns heads in a graphic bodycon dress and knee-high sparkly boots</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Katy Perry reveals her meaningful new tattoo to mark the end of an era – you have to see it" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/eef4c2ee19d9-katy-perry-tiffanys.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Katy Perry reveals her meaningful new tattoo to mark the end of an era – you have to see it" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Katy Perry reveals her meaningful new tattoo to mark the end of an era – you have to see it</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ca6fab08917-katy-perry-convent.jpg><p id=eIS_ehRuxJBz data-wc=30>Another unexpected detail was that one of the nuns reportedly exclaimed, "Katy Perry, please stop," on her deathbed.
