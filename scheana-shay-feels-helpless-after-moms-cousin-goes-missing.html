We haven’t found anything. There were a couple updates the day before yesterday — a few sightings around Mission Grove and Bathurst [Road] and in, like, a Sprouts shopping center parking lot, but we still haven’t found him, so anyone in the Riverside area, please keep your eyes out."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He is 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, and was wearing tan khaki pants when he disappeared. Tate is diabetic and has dementia.</p><p>“He is not from the area so he will definitely be confused and disoriented,” Shay’s mother, Erika van Olphen, wrote via Instagram Stories on Thursday, February 27, explaining that Tate “was visiting his mother-in-law” at Westmont Village.</p><p>Van Olphen later announced that a missing person was filed with the Riverside Sheriff’s Department and that the California Highway Patrol issued a Silver Alert. She said that local churches, homeless shelters, hospitals and parks have all been searched by authorities and loved ones.</p><p>“I will continue to report this all on here because the power of social media is SO insane,” the Bravo personality’s mom wrote. “I never know who might see this and be able to provide ANY information to help.”</p><p>In another post later on Friday, van Olphen added, “We are still searching!!!
