Moreover, Mermin claimed to be the child’s father and accused his ex-wife of keeping their child away from him for over a week while also reporting him for domestic violence. Afterward, he then seized a pistol from a table and fatally shot her in the forehead.</p><p>In the video, the camera precisely focused on a child on the floor, as Nizama urged and pleaded with someone to save the child before her husband proceeded with further terrible actions. The bodybuilder or the fitness instructor recorded two lives videos admitting to killing two more people, a man, and his young son while being chased by the police. Amidst the chaos, he informed his followers that he had fired at a policeman who managed to escape which lead to an emergency declaration.
