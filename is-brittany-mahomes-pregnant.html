Patrick, just a sophomore at the time, and Brittany, a junior, kicked off their journey together.</p><p>In the first episode of Netflix’s Quarterback docuseries, Patrick candidly shared that Brittany “was in the grade above me, I was kind of the best friend, in the friend zone forever.”</p><p>But sometimes, all it takes is a simple gesture to change the course of a friendship into something more. That moment came during Patrick’s sophomore year when he gifted her a rose on Valentine’s Day. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brittany recalled</a>, reminiscing about that pivotal moment:</p><p>“I thought it was the cutest thing in the world. And then everyone at our lunch table started chanting, ‘Kiss him, kiss him,’ and made it really awkward because we were ‘just friends.’<span>So that’s kind of what started it, and then I thought it was cute,”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Their love endured the test of time and distance as Patrick pursued his studies at Texas Tech while Brittany attended the University of Texas at Tyler, a seven-hour drive away. The miles between them couldn’t break their bond, and their relationship grew stronger.</p><p>Finally, in 2020, Patrick took the next big step and proposed. The couple celebrated their love in a grand way, getting married on February 12, 2022, in the beautiful backdrop of Hawaii, surrounded by their closest family and friends.</p><p>Their love story is not just a testament to their deep connection, but also a reminder that sometimes, the best love stories begin in high school.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2Kvs7XTrZinsV2irqm7zJ6qZqiimrSvrc2tZm1oYW2AcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hyun-bin-bio-dating-girlfriend-wife-height-weight-family.html><span>←</span><span>Hyun Bin Biography, Dating, Girlfriend, Wife, Height, Weight, Family</span></a>
