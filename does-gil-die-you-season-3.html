That means that he’s the reason that Love and Joe’s son, Henry, came down with measles. Infuriated, Love hits Girl with a rolling pin and locks him in the glass cage in the bakery basement.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Joe and Love try to dig up dirt on Gil to coerce his silence, but the only thing they find is a family secret about his son abusing women. That secret, however, comes as news to Gil. And it’s devastating news to the professor — so devastating that Gil dies by suicide in the cage.</p><p>Of course, Joe and Love use that tragic twist to their advantage…</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'You' Season 3: Joe and Love pin Natalie’s murder on Gil.</h2><p>They frame Gil for the murder of neighbor Natalie (<a href=#>Michaela McManus</a>), putting his fingerprints on the murder weapon so that it seems like he killed her.

So we did a lot of stuff in Season 2 to try to do that.”</p><p>Sera continued: “The conversation at the beginning of Season 3 was, ‘What do you think would happen if you were a viewer?’ And it’s that Michaela would be in the whole season, so we were like, ‘She’s got to go in Episode 1.’”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the ​</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</strong></a><strong>​ at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ygoKVllJ6ybsXOrmSsnZGovK95kg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dhani-harrison-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Dhani Harrison Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
