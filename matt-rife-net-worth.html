He’s been on your screen more times than you might realize, thanks to his appearances on shows like MTV’s <strong>Wild ‘N Out</strong>. He’s got charm, a killer smile, and jokes that’ll hit you right in the funny bone.</p><h3><span id=How-old-is-he-and-where8217s-he-from>How old is he, and where’s he from?</span></h3><p>Born on September 10, 1995, he hails from Ohio. Yep, he’s a Midwestern boy at heart, which probably explains some of that down-to-earth humor he’s known for.</p><h3><span id=Did-he-start-comedy-young>Did he start comedy young?</span></h3><p>You bet! He was only 15 when he decided that comedy was his calling. Imagine being that sure of anything at 15 – I was still trying to figure out my MySpace layout.</p><h3><span id=What8217s-he-famous-for-exactly>What’s he famous for, exactly?</span></h3><p>While most folks know him from Wild ‘N Out, where he flexes his improv skills, he’s also made appearances on shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Challenge. Plus, he’s a hit on the stand-up circuit, known for his relatable and often self-deprecating humor.</p><h3><span id=Any-interesting-relationships-in-his-life>Any interesting relationships in his life?</span></h3><p>His love life has been a bit of a rollercoaster, and he’s not shy about bringing it into his comedy. He famously dated actress Kate Beckinsale, which pretty much broke the internet for a while. Their age gap was the talk of the town, but hey, love is love, right?</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ueacc514eb30be82ab628a25e40884aa4><span class=ctaText>READ: </span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What is Bill Nighy Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a><h3><span id=What8217s-the-deal-with-him-and-social-media>What’s the deal with him and social media?</span></h3><p>He is a social media wizard, using platforms like Instagram and Twitter not just to share life updates but to connect with fans and share his humor. If you’re not following him yet, you’re missing out on some quality content.</p><h3><span id=Has-he-done-any-movies>Has he done any movies?</span></h3><p>While he’s best known for his TV work and stand-up, he’s also dipped his toes into the movie world. Keep your eyes peeled because he’s just getting started in Hollywood.</p><h3><span id=What-about-his-stand-up-specials>What about his stand-up specials?</span></h3><p>If you’ve been sleeping on his stand-up, it’s time to wake up. While he hasn’t released a Netflix special (yet), you can catch him live for the full experience. His sets are a mix of personal stories, observations, and the kind of humor that might make you snort-laugh.</p><h3><span id=How-does-he-feel-about-fame>How does he feel about fame?</span></h3><p>He seems to have a healthy relationship with fame. He’s all about using his platform for good laughs and staying genuine. Despite the spotlight, he comes off as pretty grounded – probably thanks to those Midwest roots.</p><h3><span id=Where-can-I-catch-more-of-him>Where can I catch more of him?</span></h3><p>Besides stalking—er, I mean, following him on social media, keep an eye out for his tour dates.
