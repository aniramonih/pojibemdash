Born in July 2006, Walton is a native of Atlanta, Georgia, and asides from being an actor, he is also a highly-skilled boxer and gymnast. Walton intends to compete in the 2024 Olympics and keeps on working towards that dream despite his booming Hollywood career.</strong></p><h2><strong>What Is Javon Walton’s Age Now?</strong></h2><p>Javon Walton is currently 17 years old. He was born in July 2006 in Atlanta, Georgia, and has a twin brother named Jaden. He also has an elder sister named Jayla, and a younger brother named Daelo. The name of Javon Walton’s parents is Jessica and DJ Walton. His dad is a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">boxing coach</a> who runs his own gym.</p><p>Javon’s dad is obviously a big boxing fan, and this influenced his young son to go into it. Javon watched boxing matches as a child and by the age of two had decided that he wanted to be like the people he saw on TV. Perhaps, his dad didn’t take him seriously, but he nevertheless started training him, and the young boy got better with each passing year. He also took an interest in gymnastics and excelled in it as well.</p><p>The 17-year-old Javon Walton has won state championships in gymnastics and boxing in Georgia. He has also competed in national tournaments as well as the junior Olympics. Walton’s target is now to compete in the Paris Olympics 2024 when he will be 18 years old.</p><h2><strong>When Did Javon Walton Start His Acting Career?</strong></h2><p>Javon Walton started acting at the age of 13 in 2019. Prior to that time, he had been busy with his boxing and gymnastic exploits and was so good that he was invited to the Steve Harvey Show in 2017. During his appearance, he asked some brilliant rapid-fire questions and did one of his gymnastic maneuvers to the delight of fans.</p><p>A clip of Walton’s performance on the Steve Harvey Show eventually made its hands to a casting director, and he was contacted and asked to try out for Euphoria. He auditioned and landed the part of Ashtray. He thereafter made his debut.</p><p>Walton’s appearance on Euphoria was supposed to be a one-off thing, but it inspired his interest in acting, and he has continued to make waves. He has appeared in other TV series such as Under The Bridge, The Umbrella Academy, and Utopia. His movie credits include The Addams Family 2 and Samaritan.</p><h2><strong>How Old is Ashtray in Euphoria?</strong></h2><p>Ashtray is 14 years old in the first season of Euphoria and turns 15 years old in the second season. He is the son of an addict mother and was abandoned as a baby. It, therefore, falls to his elder brother Fez as well as their grandmother, to raise him. The boys’ grandmother turns out to be a drug dealer, and they get introduced into the trade and take over.</p><p>It is quite rare to see a 14-year-old boy be a ruthless drug dealer, but Javon Walton did a very convincing job of portraying the role. Even though he is a bit short for his age, standing at 4 feet 9, which makes him look as if he is closer to 10 rather than his real age of 13 and thus farther away from looking 14, he still did a bang-up job.</p><p>His experience as a pugilist must have played a part. He has had to face off against taller and bigger opponents in the ring and did not cower. Therefore, he was able to portray his role with maturity. All in all, Javon Walton did a very good job in bringing Ashtray to life and he quickly became a fan favorite.</p><p>Many fans of Euphoria were therefore saddened when his character was killed off during a shootout with the police in the season 2 finale episode. Ashtray was 15 years old at the time of his death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BdvLh5zqWbZqGjYreiws6nZLCZnKm8r3nArJ%2BtqpGueqe%2BzqZknq2gnbyztcBmoKdlopqurXnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-magic-johnson-get-hiv-aids.html><span>←</span><span>How Did Magic Johnson Get HIV AIDS?</span></a>
