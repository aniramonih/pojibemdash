The game was invented by a company named Rovio Entertainment, in the year 2009.&nbsp; It lies under the genre of the causal puzzle video game. It was first released for iOS and Maemo devices.</p><p>The game gained rapid popularity, and over 12 million copies were purchased from the iOS store. So, the developer expanded his horizons and designed versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, like Android, Windows phone, and Blackberry 10 devices. On July 2015, it released its sequel, Angry birds 2, for iOS and android</p><p>An angry bird is usually a single-player game. Here, the players use a slingshot to launch birds at pigs stationed around various structures; its goal is to destroy all the pigs and collect points. New types of birds get available as one advances through the game. It got prevalent among the younger as well as an older generation because of its addictive gameplay. But, it was soon removed from the App Store and Google Play in December 2019.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>The idea of angry-looking birds with no visible legs or wings were given by Jakko Iisalo, who later became the game’s designer. They made pigs as the bird’s enemy. The gameplay was inspired by the physics games, such as Crush the Castle, which were very popular in early 2009. In its initial release, it didn’t gain much success. Later, in February 2010, it quickly reached #1 on the UK App Store as a featured app. In the middle of 2010, it then reached #1 on the paid app charts on the US App Store. Chillingo gave the final details to the game, which made it more popular among the public.</p><p>While the game was being purchased by millions of people all over the world, new issues came to light while writing new versions of the game. The major problem arose when they were developing a more modern update for the Android system, which made the team settle for a minimum set of requirements. This resulted in many newly released android phones not being able to run the game. For the users who were not able to play the game, for them, a lite version was introduced by the developers.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The initial iOS version of the game included only one episode, which was titled “Poached Eggs.” This episode had three chapters, which again contained 21 levels. As time went by, Rovio gave many free upgrades to the player that helped the players to enjoy some additional content such as new levels, new birds, and new in-game objects.</p><p>On February 11, 2010, a new episode, “Mighty Hoax,” was added in the first update. It had 21 levels each in two chapters. The players also enjoyed the “Golden Eggs” feature, where they have to find the hidden eggs and unlock bonus content. “Danger above” had three chapters, each with 15 levels. On July 18, 2010, “The Big Setup” was released, which also had three sections with 15 levels each.</p><p>Many episodes got added, which made the game more addictive. When the game completed it’s first to hear in the iOS App Store, a new event that contained 15 American Old West-themed levels in a single chapter and also included a new bird called Mighty Eagle, “Ham ‘Em High,” was released on December 23, 2010. The Mighty Eagle, which may be used once per hour to clear any uncompleted levels, was initially only available for iOS, later Rovio added it to the chrome version of the game in 2011.</p><p>Episodes like “Mine and Dine” (released on June 16, 2011) with 15 levels, which later was updated on August 24, 2011, gave the players two more 15-level chapters to play with and the episode “ Birdday Party”(released on December 11, 2011) was released to pay respect on the second anniversary of the first release of the iOS version, it included birthday cake-themed 15 levels.</p><p>On October 9, 2012, “Surf and Turf,” the final chapter and a new episode, “Bad Piggies,” was released. On its 3rd anniversary (December 11, 2012), another update was launched, which 15 new levels to “Birdday Party” and “Bad piggies” each.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Angry Birds is one of the most popular games to date. It has attracted an audience from all generations and has been successful in making them addicted to it due to its gameplay, graphics, and challenging levels. No wonder it has been successful in having many awards and achievements to its name. It was on the top-selling paid application list on both the UK App Store and US App Store in February 2010. Interestingly, the game holds a world record for being on the top chart for the most number of days.</p><p>Angry Birds was nominated at the 6th annual International Mobile Gaming Awards that was held in Barcelona, Spain, for the “Best Casual Game” in February 2010. Angry Birds was named the fourth-best iPhone game of all time in September 2010 by IGN. It won the awards of both the “Best Game App” and “App of the Year” in April 2011.
