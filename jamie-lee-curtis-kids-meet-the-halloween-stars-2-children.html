The <a href=#>Halloween</a>&nbsp;star and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Christopher Guest</strong></a>, tied the knot in 1984, and share two children, Annie and Ruby.</p><p>The famous lovebirds became the parents of their kids through adoption, having welcomed their first child, Annie, in 1986. The couple’s second child, Ruby, came along in 1996.</p><p>“Adoption was the only way for us to have a family,” Jamie once revealed to <a href=#>Pact’s Point of View</a> newsletter. “People who adopt who are fertile have a more difficult decision than when you have no other option. It becomes the viable option for you. If you want to be a family, that’s how you’re going to be it.”</p><p>Jamie also got candid about how impactful being a mother truly was amid her rise to fame. “Motherhood has changed everything in my life,” she told the publication. “When I began acting, I did not assume I would ever have a child. I made choices based on my life then … Now, I make every decision with my children in mind. I choose my roles carefully.”</p><p>The California native had several big projects premiere in 2021 and 2022. Not only did she reprise her role as Laurie Strode in two more Halloween films, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends, but she also joined the cast of the video game-inspired movie Borderlands. In October 2022, both Annie and Ruby joined their mom on the red carpet at the premiere of Halloween Ends in Los Angeles. The trio looked so happy while posing for photos together during the big night.</p><p>But no matter how packed her work schedule gets, the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner will always prioritize her husband and children. Speaking at the ICG Publicists Awards in Los Angeles in March 2019, the Freaky Friday star credited her mom’s marriage with her stepdad for instilling the importance of family.</p><p>“My mother [Janet Leigh] and stepfather [Robert Brandt] were married for 43 years, so <a href=#>I had a very good role model for that</a>,” she explained, emphasizing how grateful she feels to have created a beautiful family of her own. “I’m still married to my first husband, and we proudly have two beautiful children,” she gushed.</p><p>The A-lister clearly learned a lot from her folks, and now, she’s passing down those lessons to her children.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Jamie’s kids, Annie and Ruby, keep scrolling!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmKahlWK5prGMnKyrrJmoeqy1w6xkpp2VqXq1tMRmn5qknKTEprHNZqqtmaKoenN5wqGgpZyimrtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rip-is-central-ceed-death.html><span>←</span><span>Is Central Cee death?
