It garnered effusive praise from conservatives — including President Donald Trump — for offering a rare place on primetime network television for Trump supporters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Barr, a 65-year-old actress who ran for president as a libertarian several times and has been called out for <a href=#>controversial comments in the past</a>, had also tweeted out a conspiracy theory about Chelsea Clinton and billionaire George Soros — then attacked them both. It’s not the first time she has promoted conspiracy theories — in March, Barr tweeted and later deleted a <a href=# rel=noopener>baseless claim</a> that Trump has “broken up trafficking rings” and freed hundreds of children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,” ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said in a statement. “There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>From Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment: "Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show."<br>There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.</p>— Robert Iger (@RobertIger) <a href=#>May 29, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Barr’s comments also led to her talent agency, ICM Partners, dropping her as a client, Brad Turell, head of corporate communications at the agency, said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as individuals and as an agency,” ICM Partners said in a statement. “Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Barr’s tweet</a> on Tuesday, which has since been deleted, said: “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.” Jarrett was an adviser to former President Barack Obama and is a longtime friend of the Obamas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/roseanne.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Barr apologized later Tuesday morning “for making a bad joke” and said she was leaving Twitter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following Barr’s tweet on Tuesday, comedian Wanda Sykes, who served as a consulting producer on the Roseanne revival, announced she was leaving the show.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sara Gilbert, who stars as Roseanne’s daughter Darlene Conner in the show, called Barr’s comments “abhorrent” and said she was “disappointed in her actions.” She said in a tweet that the show Roseanne is “separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.</p>— sara gilbert (@THEsaragilbert) <a href=#>May 29, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Roseanne originally aired from 1988 to 1997. It returned to television in March in a two-part revival premiere that became the <a href=#>highest-rated comedy broadcast</a> since 2014. The premiere, which aired March 27, drew 18.2 million viewers and a 5.1 rating among adults between 18 and 49-years old, according to Nielsen data. The show was <a href=# rel=noopener>renewed for a second season</a> almost immediately after the premiere.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following the early success of the revival, President Donald Trump called Barr to <a href=#>personally congratulate</a> her on the strong ratings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamlpgHJ%2FjqumrJ2Ro7umecKapZydnKGypXnAm5po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stone-cold-steve-austin-movies-on-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>10 Best Stone Cold Steve Austin Movies Every Fan Must Watch</span></a>
