<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Mila Kunis: I Don't &amp;quot;Know How to Deal&amp;quot; With Post-Pregnancy Boobs</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Life is so difficult! <strong><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a></strong> appeared on Conan on Wednesday, Feb. 4, where she talked about her life as a new mom, and the physical transformation that has come along with giving birth to her baby daughter <strong>Wyatt Isabelle</strong>.</p><p>The Jupiter Ascending actress, 31, told Conan O’Brien that her baby girl was now “4 months and 4 days” old. “It’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me,” she added, <a href=#>echoing what she told <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> this week.</p><p>Naturally, with the cable network host, the conversation routed to something more explicit. “I saw a red carpet picture of you and it looked like <strong><a href=#>Channing Tatum</a></strong> was staring at…” O’Brien trailed, as producers flashed a hilarious pic of her costar appearing to stare directly at Kunis’ boobs on the red carpet. “Because there are changes that the body goes through. And it looks like he’s staring at your breasts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Laughing, she responded of <strong><a href=#>Jenna Dewan Tatum</a></strong>‘s husband: “That’s awful! I know him and I love him, and he really wasn’t [staring].” Kunis admitted, however, that her chest had grown significantly bigger during and after her first pregnancy.</p><p>“I don’t know how to deal with them because I’ve never had them,” <strong><a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a></strong>‘s fiancee mused. “I’ve always dressed for a flat-chested girl and all of a sudden, I’m busty!”</p><p>She added that she stays in shape using the <a href=#>Jawbone</a> UP24 band, “I walk my 10,000 steps. I’m in a little group with all my friends, it’s fun.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kunis revealed that in order to adapt to her new physique, she’s needed added support. “First of all: I needed to start wearing bras,” she said. “That was a whole new experience for me.” She has also observed that men have been staring at her chest more these days. “I’ve never had that happen before, but they’re just there,” she noted.</p><p>Despite her recent bodily adjustments, Kunis told DeGeneres this week that nothing compared to motherhood — sleepless nights included.</p><p>“I love the fact that the first three months she and I were up every night,” the new mother reflected. “I figured her out and she figured me out and she now sleeps in her own crib in her own room and I will never have that time again. So for me it was a really nice three months.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKSipJFiuLa6yKxkomWUpLu1ecqnprBlmKTEbsDOZpuemZxixKrAx2anqKukYr2zscanmKebqWKvsLvBrGRraGFqgnM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-stevens-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Stevens Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
