And she's very determined. I love all those things about her. If she wasn't my daughter, I'd want to hang out with her still. She's really good company. This whole thing has taught me that motherhood has a wealth of definitions and identities.&nbsp;There's no one way to be a mum or one way to be a 'good' mum."</p><p id=erT-jZSHiW5v data-wc=57>The star, who began acting as a child after starring in 1991 film also opened up about little Penelope following her footsteps as an actress.

She said: "When my husband and I got married we made a promise to ourselves that we would use our passport at least once a year because we just love doing that. We've kept that up happily even having a toddler.
