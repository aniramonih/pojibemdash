Naturally, this tattoo is extremely personal to him, however, why is it never on display in the Big Brother house (also known as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sound Stage 18 at CBS Studios in Los Angeles</a>)?</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>@almostsane1 posed the question via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, sparking up an intriguing conversation: “What is so controversial with Matt’s deaf Olympic rings that CBS is making him cover them up?”</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>@robbed_legend gave a response that seems to be the common consensus among Big Brother superfans, garnering a total of 135 upvotes: “It’s copyrighted so CBS can’t show it without paying a fee.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by BLUE 김바다 (@bluebeachkim)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>For those who are unfamiliar, fellow Big Brother 25 houseguest (or should we say former Big Brother 25 houseguest?) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Kim</a> also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had a censored tattoo</a> to begin the season, depicting a woman with blood coming out of her eyes on her upper right arm.
