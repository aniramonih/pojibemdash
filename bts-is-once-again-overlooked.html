But, you know, why give a s— about it? Hating is their freedom, and they have their right to hate, but if it was me, I’d rather just talk with my friends in some cafe and forget about it — rather than tweeting about it or doing some interview. I wouldn’t do that ‘cause I’m a grown-up.”</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Related News:</strong></p><ul style=text-align:justify><li><a href=# rel=noopener>BTS V Follows Bigbangs T.O.P on Instagram Before Unfollowing Him!</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>BTS RMs Will Appear on KBS News as a Guest</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>BTS</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>The Bangtan Boys, also known as <a href=# rel=noopener>BTS</a> (Korean: RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit.
