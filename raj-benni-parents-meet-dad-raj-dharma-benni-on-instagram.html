Their struggles brought them closer together than ever before.</p><p>After two seasons, the audience had a better idea of who they were and where they came from based on how they saw their choices and actions.<br>Even though the older generations get a lot of screen time, the show is mostly about how young adults figure out how to become independent and find love in or out of their community.</p><p>As two of the main characters get married in the latest chapter, there will be a lot of fancy ceremonies and parties. The celebrations started in January, when Vishal Parvani and Richa Sadana got married in Cancun.

Amrit Kapai and his longtime boyfriend Nicholas Kouchoukos then made history by getting married even though they were both gay.

His father is Guyanese and his mother is Gujarati, so he is a mix.</p><p>They didn’t get married in India like other families did. Instead, his mother moved to New Jersey when she was only 16 years old.</p><p>While she was in New Jersey for school, she met the man she would marry, and she fell in love with him. Even though they loved each other, her family wouldn’t let them get married because they were too traditional.
