She thought it was hilarious.”</p><p>Cohost <strong>Kelly Ripa</strong> then asked Priestley if he ever gets recognized at his kids’ schools.</p><p>“Not really, because I kind of look like Brandon’s dad now,” quipped Priestley, who played Brandon Walsh in the ‘90s teen drama.</p><p>Ripa, 53, reassured him: “That’s not true. You look just like Brandon, I would know.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Priestly-Says-His-Daughter-Likes-to-Watch-Beverly-Hills-90210-to-Make-Fun-of-Him-4.jpg><p>Despite getting a kick out of her dad’s heartthrob days, Ava previously proved her love for Beverly Hills, 90210.</p><p>“It’s now come full circle. … Tonight, at my daughter’s school, they held a ‘90’s theme dance for the middle schoolers. Ava just started watching old DVD’s of 90210 and absolutely ❤️ it,” Priestley’s wife, <strong>Naomi Lowde-Priestley</strong>, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in May 2019 alongside a photo of then-11-year-old Ava getting her makeup done. “She is totally obsessed and wanted to go as [<strong>Jennie Garth</strong>’s character] Kelly Taylor tonight. I can’t … worlds are colliding.”</p><p>Priestley shares Ava and son Dashiell, 14, with Lowde-Priestley, 48. The proud dad often shares glimpses of his kids via social media.</p><p>“Happy 16th Birthday to my spectacular daughter @ava.priestley! Where did the time go!?! Love you forever! #sweet16,” he captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram photo</a> of Ava behind the wheel of a car in July 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Priestly-Says-His-Daughter-Likes-to-Watch-Beverly-Hills-90210-to-Make-Fun-of-Him-2.jpg><p>That same month, the actor wished Dashiell a happy birthday via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “I can’t believe you’re 14 already!! Love you buddy!!” he wrote in the caption.</p><p>In addition to joking about his daughter’s thoughts on his breakout role, Priestley told Ripa and cohost <strong>Mark Consuelos</strong> about living with <strong>Brad Pitt</strong> “for a brief period of time” in a “really crappy part of L.A.” as a young man.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Brad wasn’t as bad as my other roommate who was an absolute disaster. Brad was OK,” Priestley revealed. “We used to play this game, all of us, to see who could go the <a href=#>longest without showering</a>.”</p><p>When asked who typically won the contest, Priestley replied: “Brad, always Brad. I don’t think he does that anymore, but back then he could go a long time without showering.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGaq5%2BjerG%2ByJ6qraSVrsBusMCunqGslad6rq3KnqpmnqWjerCyjJucr52iocZutMilo6xlaWV%2FcnyMq6alnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaden-hossler.html><span>←</span><span>Is Tik Tok star, Jaden Hossler Dating Anyone Currently?</span></a>
