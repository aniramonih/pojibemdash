<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>WWE Star Zelina Vega's Intriguing Married Life With Husband Aleister Black</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>There were a series of talks about Zelina Vega's relationship status over a few years. Back in time, when Zelina was in WWE Development, she was rumored to have dated Austin Aries. It appeared that she got bothered by the talks which she later shattered through Twitter stating:</span></p><p><span><strong>"I am going to say this once:</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>"We are NOT together and have not been together for a very long time. We were certainly NEVER married or engaged. I’ve moved on a long time ago and do not wish to be associated with him.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Zelina Vega, whose real name is&nbsp;Thea Megan Trinidad, did not skip from the dating speculation with Aleister Black in 2018. However, this time the stories came true. She not only dated him but also married him within a month of her relationship rumors.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Married To Aleister Black Since 2018</strong></span></h2><p><span>Zelina Vega is emotionally tied to the love of her life for over a year. The winner of her heart is none other than a fellow WWE wrestler, Aleister Black, aka Tom&nbsp;Budgen.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Zelina and Aleister tied their nuptial knot in late November 2018. Despite the blurred information about their wedding, Wrestling Inc.&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;of the matrimonial tie of two pro-wrestlers. Later, Zelina confirmed of her married life with Aleister through a wedding picture on her Instagram.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/zelina-vega-husband-aleister-black.jpg alt width=450 height=555 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>Zelina Vega with her husband, Aleister Black (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram/Zelina</a>)</span></p><p><span>Interestingly, Zelina Vega kept her relationship stats with her husband, Aleister Black (real name Tom Budgen) underground for several months despite some rumors. A few&nbsp;weeks before their marriage, Zelina and Aleister appeared together in media fueling the talks of their dating. The speculation of their possible romance further flamed after Aleister shared a training video with Zelina on his Instagram in November 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span><strong>Zelina In WWE</strong></span></h2><p><span>Zelina started her wrestling career in Mexico with Andrade in their partnership years. Zelina also played the Total Non-Stop Action Wrestling (TNA) for two years from 2011 to 2013.&nbsp;</span><span>Similarly, her early career summarizes her six years of wrestling in an Independent Circuit from 2011 to 2017.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Later, Zelina and Andrade reunited in NXT and&nbsp;got drafted by Smackdown in April 2018. In 2019, WWE drafted both of them during the&nbsp;2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up. Since then, she has participated in Women Royal Rumble and other efficient matches in WWE in recent years.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC%2Fz6ipratfr7Kttc2aZK%2Bdl5Z6uMPEZp%2Buq5KWu6V5zJqpq6GVmXqiuMSiqq2domKvra3CpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-do-guys-hug-pillows-when-they-sleep-104401.html><span>←</span><span>Why Do Guys Hug Pillows When They Sleep?
