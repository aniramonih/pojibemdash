He was born on 19 May 1968 in Los Angeles, California, USA. He is the son of actor/director Clint Eastwood and Maggie Johnson, and is known for his work as a musician, specifically as a bass guitarist in the jazz genre. Kyle has released multiple albums including “From There to Here” and “The View From Here”, which have contributed to his current net worth.</p><p>Kyle Eastwood’s net worth of $10 million was reported in early 2017, primarily amassed through his successful music career. His expertise lies in playing various types of bass guitars, such as the acoustic double bass and fretless electric bass guitar. As he continues to pursue his musical endeavors, it is anticipated that his wealth will continue to grow.</p><p>Growing up in a musically inclined family, with a younger sister, actress Alison Eastwood, and half-brother Scott Eastwood, Kyle was exposed to jazz music at an early age. Influenced by legends like Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk, he attended the Monterey Jazz Festival and met numerous artists, thanks to the popularity of his father, Clint Eastwood. His introduction to the bass guitar occurred during high school, where he began playing in gigs around Los Angeles and New York. Eventually, he formed the Kyle Eastwood Quartet, marking the start of his rise in net worth.</p><p>Kyle’s discography expanded with releases such as “Paris Blue” and “Now” in 2005 and 2006, respectively, after he moved to the Rendezvous label. Some of his recent albums include “The View from Here” in 2013 and “Timepieces” in 2015, both of which were released by the Jazz Village label. He has also contributed music to several of his father’s films, like “The Rookie”, “Mystic River”, “Letters from Iwo Jima”, “Invictus”, and “Million Dollar Baby”, further bolstering his net worth.</p><p>Apart from music, Kyle also dabbled in voice acting, providing his voice for characters in the video game “The Movies” and the PBS Ident “Daddy and Son”. He has also taken on supporting acting roles, notably in the 1982 Clint Eastwood film, “Honkytonk Man”, and other productions, contributing to his overall net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, Kyle married Cynthia Ramirez in 2014, and together they have a daughter. They tied the knot at “The Mission Ranch”, which is owned by his father.</p><p>Kyle Eastwood’s net worth details are sourced from [Net Worth Post](https://networthpost.org/kyle-eastwood-net-worth).
