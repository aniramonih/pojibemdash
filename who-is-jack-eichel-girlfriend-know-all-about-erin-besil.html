Before entering the league, Eichel was described at the age of 17 as “the new face of American hockey,” and he was considered a member of a rising class of generational talents in the sport. Eichel was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, and grew up in North Chelmsford, Massachusetts. He played for the USA Hockey National Team Development Program team during the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons and was recognized for his outstanding play during the 2013–14 season when he was named to the United States Hockey League Second All-Star Team.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-beginnings><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Beginnings</h2><p>After his second season within the Development Program, Eichel signed a letter of intent to commit to Boston University of the Hockey East on April 29, 2014. On April 10, 2015, Eichel became the second freshman to win the Hobey Baker Award, which was previously won by Paul Kariya in 1993. In 40 games with Boston University, Eichel led the nation in scoring with 26 goals, 45 assists, and 71 points. Eichel was also the Hockey East scoring champion, Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, First Team Hockey East, and a member of the All-Rookie Team, and was named MVP of the conference tournament.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Early Career</h2><p>Jack Eichel helped the United States win the gold medal at the 2014 World Under-18 Championship with 10 points (five goals, five assists) in seven games. Then competed as a 17-year-old at the World Junior Championship as the youngest player for the United States. On June 26, 2015, Eichel was selected second overall by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2015&nbsp;<a href=#>NHL</a>&nbsp;Entry Draft. One pick after the Edmonton Oilers selected Connor McDavid. In the months leading up to the draft, considerable interest and hype arose surrounding Eichel and McDavid, both seen as generational talents. Eichel scored his first NHL goal on October 8, 2015, becoming the youngest player in Sabres history to do so, in his first game in the NHL against the Ottawa Senators.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Who is Jack Eichel’s girlfriend?</h2><p>Jack Eichel has been in a long relationship with Erin Basil.
