After scoring against Racing Santander in 2011, Lionel lifted his soccer jersey to reveal a shirt with a message that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1350641/Lionel-Messis-mum-expensive-yellow-birthday-card-Barcelona-superstar.html>translates</a> in English, "Happy birthday, Mom."</p><p class=dh>That same year, Lionel debuted the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/argentinian-football-superstar-lionel-messi-gets-picture-of-his-mother-tattooed-onto-his-shoulder/news-story/7728d3d326f88b4cd9359b7d5db0c18f>tattoo</a> he had gotten of his mother on his shoulder while on vacation.

However, missing from the 260 guests was the majority of Lionel's family from his father's side, including aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents.</p><p class=dh>And Celia was alleged to be the reason why. Susana Messi, Lionel's aunt, accused Celia of causing a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4665766/Lionel-Messi-s-aunt-lifts-lid-bitter-family-feud.html>rift</a> between the PSG player and the one side of his family since he found fortune and fame.</p><p class=dh>Susana further asserts that even Lionel's father feels ashamed of Celia's behavior as she was deliberately keeping her husband's side of the family at a distance.

She is like that—she makes the orders. It's a matriarchy. I don't know if I would forgive her if she asked. Lionel obeys her mother and follows her path. It hurts."</p><p class=dh>Another source claimed there was a rift between Celia and her daughter-in-law and her family, whose supermarket in Argentina was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/03/football/lionel-messi-in-laws-shop-attacked-spt-intl/index.html>attacked</a>.
