During an appearance on The View Friday, Jan. 25, Barrymore explained why they've chosen to raise their daughter Jewish.</p><p>"He's a nice Jewish man from a nice Jewish family," Barrymore said of Kopelman, a 35-year-old art consultant. "I'm a shiksa [gentile]. I do the seders and we do Passover. I haven't converted yet, but Olive will be raised traditionally."</p><p>In fact, when Barrymore and Kopleman <a href=#>tied the knot</a> at her California home eight months ago, "We had a very traditional wedding ceremony with Rabbi Rubenstein and I did the ketubah," the Big Miracle actress said of the religion's prenuptial agreement. "We wore the yamakas and we did the chuppah."</p><p>Barrymore called Judaism "a beautiful faith" and said she's "so honored" to be around it. "It's so family-oriented," she explained. "The stories are so beautiful and it's incredibly enlightening. I'm really happy."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former child star — who recently launched Flower, a collection of 180 cosmetics products under $14 — is happy for other reasons, too.</p><p>"[Olive] actually has made me a morning person, so she's already made me a better person in every way possible," Barrymore gushed. "I'm like Godzilla in the morning. . . before I've had that cup of caffeine. and with her, I sing her 'Good Morning' with my husband from Singing in the Rain every day. She has the biggest smile and it's the first time I've smiled in the morning. I love it!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadqpWseqOt0auwpqeimnqiusNmrqKknGK4sLzEpaSapl2stq24jKuYoquVYsGpscirZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqaloaaaequx1qKqoWViZX50fpdqZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-frizzell-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>David Frizzell Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
