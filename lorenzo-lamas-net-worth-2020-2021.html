His father, Fernando Lamas, was an Argentine actor while his mother, Arlene Dahl, was a Norwegian American actress. Lorenzo was raised in Pacific Palisades, California. When he was a little kid, his parents got separated.</p><p>Thereafter, he moved to New York City. There is not much information about his early education, but he is said to have graduated from ‘Admiral Farragut Academy’ in 1975. Following that, he took the martial art training.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Lorenzo’s personal life has been subject to a happening life. He got married five times and is present with Shawna Craig, his 5th wife, whom he married in 2011.

His height is 1.88 m&nbsp; tall, and his weight is 80 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas is the son of actor parents, so naturally, he too dreamt of becoming an actor like his parents. In fact, he started learning acting at a very early age. After attending Tony Barr’s Film Actors Workshops, he broke into acting in 1976. It was a small TV role.</p><p>For the next four years, he made a guest appearance and cameo in a number of films, but none of them could really make him popular. Finally, in 1981, he landed a role in all-time popular TV series Falcon Crest. After this, his career remained the same no more. He continuously appeared in 227 episodes of this TV series and bagged huge accolades, acclaim, and several awards.</p><p>Along with this TV series, he appeared in other TV series and films too. However, he couldn’t gain the success that he achieved with this TV series. As he is a skilled martial artist, he majorly appeared in action movies. Bounty Tracker, Final Impact, and Snake Eater are some of the most popular films of Lorenzo.</p><p>He appeared in nearly 50 films, but only a few films turned out to be successful. He also appeared in a number of TV series, including Renegade, Leave it to Lamas, California Fever, and Falcon Crest.</p><h2>Awards & achievements</h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas has several nominations such as Razzie Award, Soap Opera Digest Award, Golden Globe Award, and Golden Rose Award.
