The royalty depends on the contribution of the actors and their roles in the series.</p><p>The American mockumentary sitcom The Office aired from 2005 to 2013. There are a total of 9 seasons of the television comedy series.</p><p>The story of the comedy series follows the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional company.</p><p>Each episode initially aired for a half-hour time slot before being extended to an hour. Season one was the shortest season of all.</p><p>The first season of the show received mixed reviews from the critics however, NBC ordered them to make season 2, which became instantly hit.</p><p>The series has been nominated for 42 Primetime Emmy Awards and has won five throughout its nine seasons.</p><p>The actors, directors, and writers also received awards and several recognitions for contributing to the series.</p><p>The comedy series&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;is still accessible on the online streaming platform Peacock. In 2020, Netflix discontinued the program.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-do-the-office-actors-make-in-royalties></span>How Much Do The Office Actors Make in Royalties?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The office actors make from $1 million to $20 million in royalties each year. The amount depends on their role and contribution to the series.</p><p>After NBC bought the program and put it into cable television syndication, the actors, producers, and creators split $500 million in revenue.</p><p>The amount each cast member makes from the royalty is unclear. However, they certainly receive millions of dollars in royalties each year.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Backstage, the royalties for The Office are determined according to the SAG-AFTRA guidelines.</p><p>After the popular show is distributed, syndicated, or purchased for streaming sites, the actors get what’s left of their salary, called royalties.</p><p>Their royalty money is determined by the SAG-AFTRA. It calculates residuals based on formulas that consider an actor’s contract.</p><p>It also includes the production type and the market where the show appears. After each episode is rerun, the payout amount is reduced.</p><figure></figure><p>So, by the 13th rerun, the amount decreases to 5% of the original fee the actor was paid for his/her appearance in an episode.</p><p>This 5 percent will be paid every time an episode is run forever. So, in general, only the main cast will receive the royalty amount.</p><p>Whereas, the background actors, guest actors, or the actors who were in extra do not usually receive the royalty amount like others.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;Marketplace, if each of the stars of the hit sitcom shows&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;received residuals at the normal SAG-AFTRA rates, they would get around $10,000 in royalties for each episode.</p><p>Now with 236 episodes in reruns, that would add up to a total sum of $2,360,000 per actor. In actuality, the cast negotiated even higher and earns close to $20 million a year in syndication.</p><p>Therefore, the amount they receive as royalty also depends on the negotiations during their time on the series.</p><figure></figure><p>Also, the less successful show also gets their reruns income, but the amounts are often small and do not add much value to their life.</p><p>Like for example, The Punky Brewster Cast receive $2 annually as part of their royalty money. The show Degrassi actor Drake got $8 according to&nbsp;Ask.</p><p>Similar to this, Two and a Half Man ended in 2015, but it still earns the money by syndication as well as the amount paid by various streaming services.</p><p>Reportedly, the lead actor Charlie Sheen earned up to 100 million dollars from his royalty income. The show is still popular among the audience and gets millions of views every year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-did-the-office-cast-make-per-episode></span>How Much Did The Office Cast Make Per Episode?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Office cast made about $100,000 per episode while on the show.
