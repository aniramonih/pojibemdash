He added that it is all natural as he has seen the hard work and the result.&nbsp;</p><p>He wrote;&nbsp;</p><p>Are we saying that women can’t work hard and transform their bodies?? I’ve SEEN the hard work and I’ve seen the results and trust me, this is all natural.</p><p>Since she was 10 years old, people been calling this woman vile things because of her weight and instead of letting the internet run her life, she went out the put the damn work in and changed her whole life. FITNESS SAVED HER LIFE! If you are a woman or man and don’t like where your body is at or just want to find new workouts to help you reach that next level, then download the FRSTPLACE app.&nbsp;</p><p>Karl also said he won’t stoop to the trolls’ levels and respond with hate, but will be&nbsp;keep being positive and hope they “find the love you are so badly craving.”</p><p>He added;</p><p>&nbsp;And so to those people, I pray and hope you find the attention but more importantly, the love you are so badly craving. And to you the one and only @jor dynwoods , I love you babe.&nbsp;Every day you make me so proud to call you my Girl, my Queen, my Rock, my everything.</p><p>That comparison picture, as I told you before you posted it, is gonna help a lot of people, especially young girls who feel they can never reach the body that you’ve acquired NATURALLY. These people feel no one understands what they go through… but you get it.</p><p>It’s sad we live in a world where if you spread positivity and love, you’re met with twice the hate and looked at as weak and “uncool”. You’ve stayed true to YOU. Through everything, you stayed loving, caring, and devoted to helping people.</p><p>This is why you will succeed in life babe, because through all the tough shit and extremely challenging times, you never changed to fit people’s narratives and agendas. You stayed true and ten toes down in everything.</p><p>I could write a book about why this world needs more people like YOU. Whatever false narratives they’ve tried to paint you in, (incredibly false narratives I would like to add) the next generation is so lucky to have you as a role model.</p><p>John is smiling down at you every day at the way you handle things and at how you treat people who don’t deserve your kindness.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async alt="Jordyn Woods" boyfriend karl-anthony towns insists her recent body transformation is natural style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699759726_535_Jordyn-Woods039-boyfriend-Karl-Anthony-Towns-insists-her-recent-body-transformation.png></p><p style=text-align:center>&nbsp;</p><p>Woods responded by writing;&nbsp;</p><p>I love you. <img decoding=async alt="Jordyn Woods" boyfriend karl-anthony towns insists her recent body transformation is natural style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center draggable=false src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/abs-0.twimg%20alt=" jordyn woods .com>&nbsp;Thank you for always motivating me to be my best and always uplifting me.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async alt="Jordyn Woods" boyfriend karl-anthony towns insists her recent body transformation is natural style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699759728_557_Jordyn-Woods039-boyfriend-Karl-Anthony-Towns-insists-her-recent-body-transformation.png></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihqKqUrrtuw86om6xlkqTGp77InqWdZZuWv615wKeroaeernq1u9anqmahnqi2tMDSZp%2Beql2nsqSxza1km6eUrnq1vsCnqp%2BnoqKutbXOp2Siq12jrrXB0ZqjaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joecy-padavic-died.html><span>←</span><span>Joecy Padavic Died: Tragic Car Accident Claims Lives of Three High School Students</span></a>
