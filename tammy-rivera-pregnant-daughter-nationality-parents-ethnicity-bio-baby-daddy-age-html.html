But has the couple opened up about the matter or are they just the hearsays? Let's dig in to find out!</p><h2>The Family That Survived A Serious Crock Up:</h2><p>Tammy Rivera seems smitten by the love of her rapper husband, Waka Flocka Flame, whom she has been partnering with for&nbsp;more than half a decade. The couple began <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> since 2011 and took a couple of beautiful years&nbsp;letting their love bloom in a forbearing mode.</p><p>After two years in 2013, with outgrowing feelings of love, they decided to get engaged&nbsp;and finally tied a knot on January 20, 2014. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The marriage didn't just form a family of two, but Tammy's daughter Charlie Rivera also joined the small family, who was actually from her&nbsp;previous relationship.</p><p>While Tammy hasn't opened up about the baby daddy, Waka adores the daughter a lot, and the family appears to be a unification of love. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Tammy Rivera in One of the happy moments with her spouse Waka and daughter Charlie.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: essence.com <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There was once a rumor of Tammy being pregnant with the couple's first child, which they denied in a meeting&nbsp;of July 2016 with IB Times.</p><p>The confusion was merely&nbsp;because of Tammy's picture, where she placed a caring hand on her round belly. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Tammy's fake pose as if she was pregnant.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: wetpaint.com <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides the rumors, the couple's relationship had gone through a bad moment, which resulted in a bitter break-up on June 5, 2016, the vivid reason being Waka's flirting demeanor with the other girls.</p><p>However, it could not take a devastating shape as Waka realized his&nbsp;mistake soon and saved the family from falling apart. In an interview with a correspondent&nbsp;of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> IB Times</a>, he said:</p><p>“Part of who I am is because of my wife. I want a family. I want the real love … I love her.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>&nbsp;He also added:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I put the good and the bad together, and I weighed it out and I was like I want a family.”</p><p>The couple also denied and cleared up rumors that Tammy is pregnant with their first child.
