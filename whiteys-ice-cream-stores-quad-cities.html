This is a local favorite and you will see why when you stop in and order your first scoop.</strong></p><p>Created in the Quad Cities, outstanding flavors of ice cream, malts, shakes of every kind, banana splits, sundaes. These ice cream shops are also known for their squeaky clean interiors - all done up in white and red, right down to the uniforms worn by their ice cream servers. Whitey’s Ice Cream has been named “Best in the Midwest” according to the readers of Midwest Living Magazine.</p><p>Family owned and operated, the first shop opening in 1933 near the present day location of their ice cream shop. Whitey’s Ice Cream was established by Chester “Whitey” Lindgren, who was so nicknamed because of his white-blonde hair. Whitey’s Ice Cream remained a one-store business until 1977, when a second store was opened on 41st Street in Moline, IL. Gradually, the manufacturing facility and offices were relocated to this larger location. This first step in Whitey’s Ice Cream growth had proven successful, and the Tunbergs didn’t wait another forty-four years before they opened another store. In 1982, stores were opened in East Moline, IL and Rock Island, IL.</p><p>The Mississippi River was crossed in 1984, when a store was opened in Bettendorf, IA. Since then, another store was opened in Moline, IL at Southpark Mall, three stores have been opened in Davenport, IA, including one at Northpark Mall, one store was opened in downtown Iowa City, IA and another was opened at Coral Ridge Mall in Coralville, IA. In 1988, Whitey’s Ice Cream saw a dramatic change with the addition of a Wholesale Department and entrance into the grocery store market. This allowed Whitey’s Ice Cream packaged ice cream to be purchased from many more outlets. The Wholesale Department currently distributes to grocery stores and schools in a one hundred mile radius. Furthermore, Whitey’s Ice Cream is now available to the entire country through on-line ordering. Their ice cream can be sent anywhere in the continental United States via FedEx simply by accessing www.whiteysicecream.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrJqLCipJyeu7C10meaqKVfmsWxuM6rnGikmajBqrrGaK6hoaSaxrR5yJycZpuimq6uedKtpqudo2K%2Btq3DZpqirJmawHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-mary-bell-now-child-killer-update-today-in-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is Mary Bell Now?
