<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Jim Ross Seemingly Supports Anti-AEW Tweet About Dante Martins Injury</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Jim Ross is a WWE Hall of Famer and was the voice of several generations of fans, as he gave decades of&nbsp;<a href=#>his life to the business</a>. Ross has been part of several iconic moments in professional wrestling, and he continues to be respected even now. Ross is very vocal about his opinions when it comes to his workplace and more. Now it seems he seemingly supported a tweet that was anti-AEW in nature.</p><p>Being a veteran, Jim Ross is well aware of how the pro wrestling world functions and how certain things in AEW can be perceived. Fans also largely agree with what he has to say, for the most part.</p><p>Good ole’ JR has been the voice of AEW since the very beginning, but the years are seemingly catching up to him. Jim Ross was moved to a full-time commentator role on Rampage last year, and he has commented on only a select few matches during AEW pay-per-views as well. In fact, Ross has been used less in the past few weeks and had a reduced schedule in general.</p><p>During the ROH Supercard of Honor event, Dante Martin suffered an injury during a scary spot. Many people were vocal against AEW for allowing such accidents to even happen in the first place. As it turns out, Jim Ross seems to have liked a tweet from a page called All Elite Botches, which condemned Martin’s injury.</p><p>It should be noted that Jim Ross is quite vocal about the fact that he has not been used often. Therefore, liking this tweet might be a form of protest for Jim Ross, if nothing else.</p><p>Dante Martin <a href=#>will also be out of action for long time due to the injury</a>. Regardless, we will have to wait and see whether AEW will decide to use Jim Ross more as a color commentator in the coming weeks.</p><p>What’s your take on Jim Ross supporting the anti-AEW tweet? Are you surprised by Jim Ross’ action? Sound off in the comments!</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e49tZmlpX5%2B2rnnRqKqsZaOasq61zaCjsmWjqr2xu9GtqmaZnqm2bq3EsGStr5WawW6twaisrWWUlru1sYymmKusmaPAbrXNo6yrsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jim-lampley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jim Lampley Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
