That’s a big thing to, you know, not talk to your wife about.”</p><p>Though she didn’t get a heads-up before the announcement, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star doesn’t think that invalidates West’s plans.&nbsp;</p><p>“I believe he is serious, and I know if he puts his mind to something he’ll do his best,” she said of the Grammy winner and fashion designer, 38. “It’s been fascinating hearing all the conversations that’ve gone on since that announcement. I don’t know if that was planned, and I just didn’t know about it, or if he came up with that idea right then and there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Does Kardashian, 34, who has previously lent her support to 2016 candidate <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, think she’ll one day be sitting in the Oval Office alongside her president husband? If so, she doesn’t think it will look the same as it currently does.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am looking forward to what’s to come,” she said, adding, “I think it would be so much fun to be in the White House. I was joking with him, I was like, ‘You’re going to have to make it to a second term,’ because he loves redecorating. So I was like, ‘You’re going to want to redo the whole White House, and we’re not going to be able to enjoy it.’”</p><p><strong>Tell Us: </strong>Would you vote for Kanye West for president?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYriiutieZLCdo6l6tLHRoqauq12Wr7DB02aprqaenruoec%2BrnKyhlJq7tXmRaWhua2Bu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-jong-il-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Jong-il Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
