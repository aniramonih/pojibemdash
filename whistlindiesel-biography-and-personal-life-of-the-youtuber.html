He is currently 25 years old. He grew up in a town in rural Indiana alongside his family, who were into farming, construction, and automobile business.</p><p>Whistlindiesel isn’t vocal about his family, so information about his parents and siblings is not readily available. Moreover, his family has ties with a strict religious group that does not subscribe to a ‘worldly’ lifestyle. They live a quiet life away from the public eye, and Cody prefers to keep it that way.</p><h3><strong>Whistlindiesel’s Real Name Is Cody Detwiler</strong></h3><p>WhistlinDiesel has become the brand name of popular Youtuber Cody Detwiler. All his social media accounts go by the name WhistlinDiesel, and as you can guess, the name is derived from his love for cars and speed. His real name – Cody Detwiler, is rarely used. However, on his <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, he has the name Cody on his profile, as well as CEO of Destruction and Chaos Engineer.</p><p>His YouTube career officially kicked off in 2019 when he was twenty-one years old. Within a few years, he was already raking in millions of views on his videos, making him an overnight success. Of course, he put in the required work to achieve his millionaire status.</p><h3><strong>WhistlinDiesel Had a Strict Religious Upbringing</strong></h3><p>WhistlinDiesel was<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> raised</a> as a member of Jehovah’s Witness. His parents were converts, so naturally, Cody was brought up with strict religious standards. This meant little to no associating with people outside the group. However, he attended a public high school, exposing him to life outside his strict religious group.</p><p>His sheltered life meant that his engagement with video streaming took off much later in life. Aside from school and religious activities, WhistlinDiesel also went on hunting trips with his dad. At the age of sixteen, he <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">recorded</a> his first ever bow kill (hunting large animals with bow and arrow).</p><h3><strong>He worked in Construction Before Venturing Into YouTube</strong></h3><p>After graduating high school, WhistlinDiesel took up a nine-to-five job working for his dad in the family’s construction company. It was tedious work that had him working in hot temperatures during summer and freezing temperatures during winter.</p><p>At the time, his monthly income was around $1600. Interestingly, young Cody got married within this period at just eighteen years old. This was mainly due to religious reasons that prohibited him from having a girlfriend.</p><h2><strong>WhistlinDiesel’s YouTube Career Has Caused a Rift With His Family&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>WhistlinDiesel opened his YouTube Channel as far back as 2015. However, he remained inactive for several years. After graduating high school, he worked in the family business for a while. He decided to try his luck as a content creator after learning that he could make money as a YouTuber. So in 2019, he officially began posting adventure videos on his channel. His new line of work meant turning back on some of the religious values he grew up with.</p><p>Inevitably he was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">shunned</a> by the Jehovah’s Witness group, causing serious strain on his relationship with his family. However, WhistlinDiesel is happy with his choice; he even confessed that the reason he speeds so much is because he is trying to catch up with lost time, referring to those periods he was constrained from pursuing his dreams because of his religious belief.</p><h2><strong>His Content Ranges from Car Modification to Dangerous Stunts&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As WhistlinDiesel, Cody began posting<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;videos</a> of himself demolishing trucks, modifying cars, and attempting various dangerous stunts. His content was new and exciting, thus attracting a lot of views within a short period. The experimental nature of his videos made him a darling to most car lovers who love to see him try out new stuff with his trucks and farming equipment. With time, he began adding expensive cars to collections.</p><p>His antics include; putting buggy wheels on cars, riding his Monstermax on dangerous terrains, constructing bizarre wheels for his vehicles, testing the durability of some cars, etc. He has purchased a firetruck, a tank, a helicopter, and several luxury cars (Bugatti, Ferrari, Tesla) to experiment on. His videos have likewise amassed millions of views, with more than six hundred million views on all his videos.</p><p>With this figure, WhistlinDiesel is seriously cashing out through YouTube ads. His popularity also means he is making money through brand sponsorships, and there are suggestions that he might have a contract with YouTube to create content, just like Mr. Beast has.</p><p>In addition, his<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> merch</a> is also a source of income for the entrepreneur. Branded hoodies, shirts, caps, stickers, and other decorative items are available for fans on various online shopping platforms.</p><p></p><h2><strong>WhistlinDiesel’s Social Media Stats</strong></h2><p>Here is a list of WhistlinDiesel’s handles and the number of followers he has;</p><ul><li>YouTube: WhistlinDiesel has the most following on his Youtube channel (@whistlindiesel), with more than five million subscribers.</li><li>Instagram: On Instagram (@whistlindiesel), he has close to three million followers.</li><li>Facebook: His Facebook page (@whistlindieselofficial) has more than three million followers.</li><li>Twitter: On Twitter (@whistlindzl), where he isn’t very active, he has the least following, with more than thirteen thousand followers.</li><li>TikTok: On TikTok (whistlindieselvstiktok), he has more than a million and a half followers.

For example, it is rumored that he had issues with Bunker Branding Co, a top online merchandise store for social influencers.</p><p>Such companies charge expensive premiums on merch sales for their clients.
