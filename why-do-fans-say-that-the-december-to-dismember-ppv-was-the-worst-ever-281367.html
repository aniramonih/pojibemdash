Out of those 6 or 7 matches on the card, only 2 were announced ahead of time. I vaguely recall viewing the card 6 days before the pay pay view, and the only matches announced were Hardy's v MNM and the Elimination Chamber. You do not announce 2 matches ahead of time and expect people to pay for the entire card, unless its Rock vs Cena or something to that extent. Below you will see why they didn't announce them ahead of time:</p><p>Matt Striker vs Balls Mahoney<br>-Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay vs The F.B.I.<br>-Daivari (with The Great Khali) vs Tommy Dreamer<br>-Kevin Thorn & Ariel vs Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly (with the Sandman coming out at the end of the match)</p><p>Do I REALLY have to explain why this card was so bad, especially the undercard. The only superstar that got over with the company a year later was The Great Khali, and Kelly Kelly but even she flunked years later. None of them are superstars people pay to see. Combine them all together, and I wouldn't even watch that card for free on ECW.</p><p>Hardy's v MNM was a decent match from what I remember, but I believe there was little build up to that match also. And now for the finale:</p><p>-The <b>EXTREME</b> Elimination Chamber match featuring: CM Punk, Rob Van Dam, Test (R.I.P.), Bobby Lashley, Hardcore Holly, and the Big Show who entered as the ECW champion. But Bobby Lashley walked out the chamber as the new ECW champion.</p><p>Without question, the worst Elimination Chamber match of all time. Sure on paper it looks decent, but back in 2006... CM Punk was a nobody, a glorified ex-ROH wrestler who had yet to prove himself on the big stage. Sure he was on DX's Survivor Series team prior to that, but he was almost like an extra, making up the numbers. He was a mid-carder at best, lucky he was on ECW, he wouldn't have survived on the main rosters back then.</p><p>RVD was RVD. Not a guy people pay to see. Test, was freaking shit. Lashley was fairly unestablished at that point, though I guess this was the lead into his main run in the company. But even in his PRIME, nobody gave a crap about him. This was before his prime. Hardcore Holly is an undercard wrestler at best. And the Big Show was well.. slightly more relevant than what he is now, which isn't saying much.</p><p>It was a shambles of a pay per view, I watched it for free, but if I paid, I would have demanded my money back. Absolutely shocking. And the Great American Bash 04 had more star power than this.. for one, it had, you know, the WWE Championship on the line!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnp53GbrDOZp2apqNiwKLFjK2fmqxdqbWmecOemp6lkpq%2FbsDOZpuiq52auqOx0Wanqa5drK60edOhnGavn6fAtXnEr5yrZmJtfnSClmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-won-big-brother-18-final-hoh-spoilers-round-1-endurance-winner-is-paul-james-and-nicole-face-off-in-round-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who Won Big Brother 18 Final HoH Spoilers: Round 1 Endurance Winner is Paul James and Nico</span></a>
