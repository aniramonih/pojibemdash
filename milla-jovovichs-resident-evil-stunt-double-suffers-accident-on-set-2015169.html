The cast and crew of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter have been totally devastated and are waiting with bated breath for news on her recovery -we now understand she is stable and being carefully monitored by very experienced South African doctors.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Jovovich wasn’t there when the accident occurred, but was told details about the “awful” circumstances. “None of us have experienced anything like this in our careers making action films and hope we never do again,” she shared. “But the production reacted very quickly to ensure she received the best care and also in reaching out to her family and making sure they were informed and looked after during this overwhelmingly difficult time. Thank God, they have been by her side through out this harrowing week.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s a miracle that she survived,” the Fifth Element actress continued. “I didn’t know her very well, as we were all just getting going with the film, but the few times we rehearsed together, I really looked up to her because she danced through the choreography, beautiful and graceful. It’s a testament to Olivia’s strength that she managed to survive and also the quick reaction of our on set safety officer and his team that she has finally been pronounced stable.”</p><p>Jovovich concluded her note by asking fans to pray for Jackson. “All of us here have been praying every single day for her and her family and sending our thoughts out hoping some of the positive energy reaches her, because she truly needs it…” she wrote. “I would really appreciate it if you would take a moment out of your busy days ahead and pray for Olivia’s full recovery too. She needs all the help she can get right now and every bit of the good energy we can send.”</p><p>Jovovich is currently filming the sixth and final installment of Resident Evil alongside <strong>Wentworth Miller </strong>and <strong>Ali Larter.</strong> Jovovich’s husband, <strong>Paul W.S. Anderson</strong>, is directing the movie, which is slated for a January 2017 release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSipJyWequ71aitopuYqHqzsdKim56mpGKyt7XLZqqtrZ6peqW71JujnmWjqrOnsdGsZJqbk56xprrTZqanZaOawW5%2Bj2psam5p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./masika-kalysha-husband-who-did-she-marry.html><span>←</span><span>Masika Kalysha Husband: Who Did She Marry?</span></a>
