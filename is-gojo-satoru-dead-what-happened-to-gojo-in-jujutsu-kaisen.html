What Happened To Gojo In Jujutsu Kaisen?</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-236-spoilers-jpg-2000×1000-.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The world of anime and manga has been set ablaze with the recent events of “Jujutsu Kaisen.” The manga has always been a beacon of innovation and suspense, but chapter 236 has propelled it to an unprecedented realm of discussion and debate. The crux of it all? The unforeseen and harrowing end of the seemingly unbeatable Gojo Satoru.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened in Chapter 236?</h3><p>The chapter bears witness to the climax of an epic confrontation between two of the manga’s most powerful entities: Gojo Satoru and Sukuna. This isn’t just a battle of physical might, but a clash of ideals, methodologies, and intrinsic powers that define the very core of the series.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mahoraga: The Trump Card Against Infinity</h3><p>But what could possibly defeat someone as formidable as Gojo and his famed Infinity Technique? The answer lies in Mahoraga, a potent force that Sukuna strategically employed to outclass Gojo’s defenses. Sukuna’s reliance on Mahoraga was not a mere afterthought; it was a meticulously calculated move, which he had been plotting for some time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Mahoraga Seal Gojo’s Fate?</h3><p>Gojo’s Infinity Technique, revered and feared by many, was neutralized by the crafty manipulation of Cursed Energy by Mahoraga. By directly targeting this technique, Mahoraga rendered Gojo vulnerable. In chapter 234, readers gasped as Mahoraga exhibited a slash so profound, it didn’t just target Gojo – it aimed to disrupt the very fabric of space itself.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Aftermath of the Battle</h3><p>Two chapters later, in the much-discussed chapter 236, we see the aftermath of this confrontation: Gojo Satoru, the powerhouse of the Jujutsu world, lies defeated. Sukuna’s words, observing Gojo’s fate, were a chilling testament to the sheer might of Mahoraga and its capability to override the Infinity Technique.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Could Gojo Satoru Make a Return?</h3><p>While the manga has left readers with a heavy heart, speculations are rife about possible scenarios of Gojo’s comeback. The primary glimmer of hope that many fans cling to is the Reverse Cursed Technique (RCT). Are the odds in favour of Gojo being restored or at the very least preserved with his head still attached? Only time will tell.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Bigger Picture: Implications for the Jujutsu World</h3><p>Gojo’s demise marks more than the death of one character; it marks an enormous shift in Jujutsu history and power dynamics. Without him around to influence matters, allies and adversaries alike will need to reevaluate their strategies – and perhaps new powers may emerge as well.</p><p>Chapter 236 of “Jujutsu Kaisen” is not just another chapter; it’s a defining moment in the series. With the fall of Gojo Satoru, the narrative has taken an unexpected turn, making readers even more eager for what lies ahead. Whether Gojo returns or not, his legacy and the impact of this battle will reverberate throughout the series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZIFxg5ZooKxll6S3sHnSmquoqqVisaatw2auoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brPOo6ZmoZ5it7a21K2qrmWblra0sc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-spell-porch.html><span>←</span><span>How to spell porch</span></a>
