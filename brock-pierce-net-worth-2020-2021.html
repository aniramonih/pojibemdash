From setting up a business at seventeen to battling controversies both at a professional and personal level, Pierce seems to have come a long way.</p><p>Maybe you know about Brock Pierce very well but do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Brock Pierce’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>There is very little out there that people know of his early life despite the fact that he starred in commercials as a toddler. He was born to Lynette Pierce and Jeffrey Pierce. Born on 14 November 1980, in Minnesota, United States of America, Pierce has a famous brother, Scott Pierce. In his initial years by virtue of his association with the entertainment world, he wanted to be studying films, so he enrolled at the University of Southern California. Unfortunately, he did not complete his graduation.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Pierce is married to an entrepreneur, Crystal Rose.&nbsp; They were wed in a Unicorn-themed wedding in 2018. Their marriage is a “smart contract” that can be dissolved, changed or renewed annually. The duo is into crypto-currency, and that is how they met. On 18 March 2019, Aurora Rose Pierce, their daughter was born.</p><p>Crystal in her own rights is the top-funded female-led Blockchain startup in Southern California called Sense, the Co-Founder of a leading cryptocurrency producer, Co-Founder of an all-women’s Blockchain fund and also among the top 20 influential women in Blockchain. Apart from being a celebrated entrepreneur, she has braved all odds and controversies surrounding her husband, Brock Pierce. The couple are mostly seen attending seminars on cryptocurrency and Blockchain.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 14 November 1980, Brock Pierce is 43 years old as of today’s date 22nd July 2024. His height is 1.64 m tall, and his weight is 72 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Brock Pierce came into limelight as early as 1992 as a child artist in The Mighty Ducks. He continued as Gordon Bombay in D2: The Mighty Ducks. Later in 1996, he starred as Luke Davenport in First Kid. Other movies where he was seen are Little Big League (1994), Ripper Man (1995), Problem Child 3: Junior in Love (1995), Three Wishes (1995), Earth Minus Zero (1996), and The Ride (1997).</p><p>By the age of 17, Pierce was pretty much done with acting; he wanted to start something of his own and hence invested in Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), with his partners Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Shackley. The establishment got $88 million in venture capital. DEN’s would cater to a nice audience by delivering original episodic video content over the Internet. Pierce produced its first show, a pilot for gay teenagers called Chad’s World. At the age of 18, Pierce was already making a quarter of a million annually and as a minor partner of DEN held 1% of the company’s shares.</p><p>But 1999 turned out to be a bad year for DEN with news of the Brock Pierce scandal spreading everywhere. It was alleged that the owners Collins-Rector and Shackley were involved in sexual harassment in a party that Pierce had organized. Pierce himself was named as an offender, though he was later acquitted. But following this episode all three of them had to resign from DEN, and Capitol Records President Gary Gersh and former Microsoft executive Greg Carpenter took the reins of the company. In June 2000 DEN shut down after filing for bankruptcy.</p><p>After the fall of DEN, in 2001 Pierce founded Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE). To support the gaming world, he introduced ZAM, a network of websites oriented around massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG), such as World of Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Rift, EverQuest, etc., in 2003. IGE pioneered MMORPG. Between 2004 and 2005, I spent more than $25 million buying out seven smaller competitors, including four auction platforms and a number of fan and content sites. 50% of the US online gaming market was captured by Pierce’s company, roughly $500 million in annual volume. ZAM was purchased by Tencent in 2012.</p><p>By then, Pierce had already proven himself as a pioneer of the gaming industry. So in 2010, Titan Gaming recruited Pierce to its board along with EA Executive Keith McCurdy. Titan Gaming purchased the rising online gaming network Xfire from Viacom. But in October 2011, Xfire and Titan Gaming became separate entities after the former received fresh funding of over $4 million from Intel Capital. In April 2012 Titan Gaming received new funding worth $1.5 million. The company announced that it would be rebranded as Playsino and Pierce was named the new CEO.</p><p>In 2013 Pierce joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) that reportedly raised $85 million. Pierce announced a $50 million Initial Coin Offering (ICO) by BCC in February 2017. The new currency was launched in June 2017 and named EOS. It was marketed through Block.one, an entity that developed “end-to-end solutions to bring businesses onto the blockchain from strategic planning to product deployment”. This initiative was supported by the EOS.IO software created by Brendan Blumer and programmer Dan Larimer, Block.one’s CEO and CTO, respectively. Pierce became the chief strategy officer, but in March 2018 he resigned from Block.one.</p><p>While still at Block.one, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the Bitcoin Foundation. But his election was not received well, given his already tarnished image as a sex offender. The company was closed in July 2015.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Pierce’s knowledge about crypto-currency and Blockchain is unparalleled. He has been a guest speaker at the Milken Global Conference, Singularity University, and Caltech.</p><p>He was also one of the esteemed members and recipient of the Crypto Awards 2018.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Pierce Brock in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brock-Pierce-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Forbes magazine named Pierce one of the “top 20 wealthiest people in crypto” in 2018. His net worth is estimated to be $1 Billion as of July 2024. He’s been one of the key stalwarts of digital currency, raising more than $5 billion for companies he has founded. Block one alone sold over $4 billion tokens in the EOS crowd sale.</p><p>Pierce is also one of the early investors in Bitcoin and one of the largest investors in the Ethereum crowd sale. He is the founder of IMI Exchange, the world’s leading digital currency marketplace for games. IMI Exchange has annual sales exceeding $1 billion.</p><p>Brock Pierce’s market value is on the rise as the market for gaming, and digital currency has been growing in leaps and bounds. He is not only on the board for many of these online gaming companies, but he himself continues to establish new entities in the market. As of 2019, Pierce is investing and supporting the advancement of Puerto Rico’s entrepreneurs for building a self-sustainable economy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZK%2Bzu8KkZKmhlaewpnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpaWViZX9yew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./britains-got-talent-week-3-review-nutty.html><span>←</span><span>Britain's Got Talent Week 3 Review: Nutty</span></a>
