Selena was born in Grand Prairie, Texas on July 22, 1992. The pair met in high school. The two got married and gave birth to Selena when Mandy was only 16 years old.</p><p>A few years later, the couple split up. Selena was only 5 at the time of the separation of her parents and was mostly raised by her mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena and Drew Taggart – What’s going on between them?</h2><p>A new couple has been introduced in Hollywood recently. The new couple, Selena Gomez and Drew Taggart have been secretly dating according to multiple reports.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">US Weekly</a> states: <strong>“They aren’t trying to hide their romance by sneaking around at members-only clubs.”</strong> The couple is acting pretty casual and they’re staying lowkey.</p><p>The <a href=#>news</a> went viral on the internet after the chainsmoker star ended things with Apple’s CEO <a href=#>Steve Jobs</a>’ daughter, Eve Jobs. Taggart has also been linked to Haley Rowe, Meredith Mickelson, and Chantel Jeffries.</p><p>Selena, on the other hand, keeps her relationships very private. She broke up with singing sensation <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> back in 2018. Selena was also linked with <a href=#>The Weeknd</a> in the past.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena blames her mother for their parent’s divorce</h2><p>Even though Selena’s mother, Mandy, raised her in the absence of her father, Selena blames her mother for parents’ separation.</p><p>In an interview, Selena said, <strong>“I blamed my mom a lot [for the divorce] because I wanted a family so bad. I wanted to have my mom and dad together. I remember just being angry with my mom. I still feel really bad about that.”</strong></p><p>Amanda worked really hard as a single mother to raise Selena. Although the accusations of her daughter really hurt her, she hopes that she (Selena) would understand someday.</p><p>The singer did appreciate her mom’s efforts on a few occasions. She said, <strong>“It’s because of mom that I am able to do things on my own. I am a professional. I am punctual. I like being nice to people, and I know that I’m reflecting on her(my mom) at the end of the day.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena’s father’s troubled past</h2><p>Ricardo’s full name is Ricardo Joel Gomez. Selena’s father has had a very disturbing past. He was legally charged multiple times for drug possession and domestic violence. Ricardo was not Selena’s biological father.</p><p>Mandy gave birth to Selena with her first husband named Brian Teefey. They met in high school and got married when they were young.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2FxKWcp5ldnLyusdlmp5qqlaPBtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-murray-children-meet-caitlyn-melissa-murray-river-james-murray.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Murray Children: Meet Caitlyn Melissa Murray, River James Murray</span></a>
