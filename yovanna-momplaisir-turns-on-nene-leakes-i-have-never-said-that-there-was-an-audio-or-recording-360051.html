Now the woman who was exposed as the snake is speaking up for herself.</p><p>If you’ve been keeping up with this story, you’d know that <a href=#>Yovanna Momplaisir has been named as the person who told Nene Leakes</a> that Cynthia Bailey had been badmouthing her.</p><p>This lead to Nene telling Kandi Burruss that there was audio that translated to the ladies as a recording.</p><p>During the installment not only did Marlo Hampton out Yovanna as the one with the information but castmates and viewers also learned that there may not have been a recording at all.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Rg6AcJecq/</a></p><p>Yovanna visited Sister Circle where she attempted to clear her name.</p><p>‘I’m here to set the record straight. I have never said that there was an audio or recording. I have never recorded anyone, that is not my character, that is not who I am. Just because I said I had receipts, that did not mean that that was the definition of an audio or a recording. That is a rumor that was started and it spread like wildfire.’</p><p>She then placed the blame of the mix up on Nene.</p><p>‘She said the word audio recording. I said I had receipts. I never used those words with her.’</p><p>When asked by the Sister Circle hosts if there is an audio recording of Cynthia trashing Leakes that exists, she responded: ‘Not to my knowledge. Have you heard one? When y’all hear it let me know ’cause I ain’t heard it yet.’</p><p>Although this makes snakegate even more confusing, she decided to clear up rumors that she wasn’t allowed to film with the ladies after the dramatic argument she had with Porsha Williams.</p><p>‘That is the first of my knowledge. I guess you guys will have to keep watching, but I will give you a teaser. I did film with the ladies a few times after Toronto, so you will continue to see me.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Yovanna suddenly turning on Nene?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeppMOius2aZKannaW5orXSoqlmrKWnu7R5zqdkp52emnqtscCknKxlmWK1osLEZqWerpWnerStyJ1kraCRqXq1tMSrnGavkah6orqMmqydoZ9ivLN50Z6aqKqUnruoeZJvZ2ltYWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato-exposed.html><span>←</span><span>Wilmer Valderramas Dating History with Underage Girls Exposed over Demi Lovatos Song 29</span></a>
