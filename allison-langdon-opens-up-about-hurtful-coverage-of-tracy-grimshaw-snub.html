So well done her for being up at 6am,” Langdon began.</p><p>“I think the problem was that she knew I was the new host – it hadn’t yet been announced – so she and I had been talking a lot. And I think in that moment, she’s overwhelmed because, if you know Trace, she hates a fuss.</p><p>“So we’re all standing and cheering her, and it wasn’t her favourite place to be. And it was like, ‘Gee, hang on, if I give Ally a hug and that gets snapped, then [people might know she’s the new host].’”</p><p>Elsewhere in the wide-ranging chat, Langdon also revealed why she thinks breakfast shows regularly generate media headlines, with publications often picking up on everything from awkward on-air moments, to controversial opinions and developments in the host’s personal lives.</p><p>“You’re putting sleep-deprived people in front of a national audience and then a lot of it’s not scripted and you’re saying, ‘Off you go for the next three-and-three-quarter hours’,” she said.</p><p>“There’s scrutiny because sometimes you say stuff when you’re a little bit tired.”</p><p>Langdon said she experienced the struggles of being exhausted on live TV after returning to the show following a knee injury in 2021, which she <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=07930bff06fe6309becde9c9b8a7899b data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>suffered on-air in a hydrofoil segment</a> gone wrong.</p><p>“There was a period when I came back after I had my surgery and did the show on pain relief medication Endone [opioids] for several months,” she revealed.</p><p>“We’d get to an ad break and Karl would be like, ‘OK, cool, cool, cool. Do you know what you just said?’ I’d be like, ‘No.’ But I got away with more than he did.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“He got away with nothing.
