His R&B albums, including the self-titled "Tyrese" (1998), "2000 Watts" (2001), and "Black Rose" (2015), garnered critical acclaim and commercial success. Gibson's acting career took off in 2001 when he was cast as Roman Pearce in the blockbuster "2 Fast 2 Furious," the second installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise.

Both books&nbsp;were New York Times bestsellers.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Gibson married Norma Mitchell in 2007. The couple had a daughter in 2007. They divorced in 2009. In 2017, Norma took out a temporary restraining order against Tyrese. In the request she alleged that he abused her and their daughter. A few months later Tyrese and Norma Gibson became embroiled in a custody battle over their daughter Shayla. Norma accused Gibson of allegedly hitting their child and requested another restraining order. Her claims were rejected by the court. The judge also put a limit on the child support costs Norma could bill Tyrese for.</p><p>In 2019, Tyrese filed a complaint against his ex-wife for violating the terms of their joint custody.</p><p>On February 14, 2017, Tyrese married Samantha Lee. Their daughter was born on October 1, 2018.</p><h2 id=samantha-lee-divorce><strong>Samantha Lee Divorce</strong></h2><p>In December 2020 Tyrese and Samantha announced their separation.</p><p>At one point in their divorce process, Samantha requested $20,000 per month in child support. Tyrese called that amount "unreasonably high" and pushed the court to enforce their prenup. Samantha also requested a 2016 Range Rover, while Tyrese offered her a 2017 Land Rover Discovery instead.</p><p>On April 25, 2023 a judge in Fulton County, Georgia ordered Tyrese to pay Samantha $237,000 in back child support PLUS $400,000 to her attorney. Tyrese had been paying $2,236 per month when he was supposed to be paying $10,000. In addition to paying the back child support, the judge also ordered Tyrese to begin paying $10,000 per month as he had been previously ordered.</p><h2 id=financial-problems><strong>Financial Problems</strong></h2><p>In November 2017, Tyrese posted a cryptic message to Instagram in which he claimed he was "desperate and broke." The video was connected to his ongoing divorce and child custody battle with his ex-wife Samantha. Tyrese claimed that he was pissed off at <a href=#>The Rock</a> for delaying a future "Fast And Furious" movie by sidetracking the franchise with a spinoff. Tyrese asserted that he desperately needed the paycheck because his ex had bled him dry between child support and legal fees. He also claimed to have received a $5 million loan from <a href=# title="Will Smith Net Worth">Will Smith</a> and Jada Smith. The Smiths denied they had lent him any money.</p><p>Tyrese eventually posted a follow up explanation to social media in which he claimed some of his bizarre posts were the result of an adverse reaction to medication.</p><p>In a court filing around this time, Tyrese listed his monthly income at $105,000, which sounds like a lot but unfortunately he also listed his monthly expenses as $107,000. Tyrese further claimed to have just $900,000 in the bank and real estate assets worth $1.7 million. He also owed his lawyers around $133,000.</p><p>During his August 2022 divorce alimony case against ex-wife Samantha Lee, her lawyers revealed that in 2018 – a year when Tyrese claimed to be broke – he made $2 million. In response Tyrese retorted to the lawyer:</p><p>"<strong>I don't do the CFO thing. Here's a question for you smart person..</strong>." at which point the judge cut him off and threatened to hold him in contempt.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In December 2017, just a few months after claiming to be broke, Tyrese and his wife Samantha paid $4 million for a 25,000 square foot mansion in Atlanta's Buckhead suburb. Scattered throughout the home are a number of replica Transformers. Gibson has mini Optimus Prime in the first-floor home office and a large-scale Optimus in its own covered shelter in the backyard by the pool as well as a towering replica of Bumblebee in the foyer to greet visitors. The seven-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bath home has a personal recording studio, complete with a vocal booth and velvet walls.</p><p>In May 2021, Tyrese put a home located in Woodland Hills, California on the market for just under $3.5 million. He lowered the price to $2.9 million in January 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMG6vsSsnGafmZfAsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tessa-thompson-latex-bra-power-suit-6822158.html><span>←</span><span>Tessa Thompson Wore a Latex Bra Under Her Power Suit for a Sexy Spin on a Classic Silhouette</span></a>
