This revocation does not impact application to future events, and we hope that you will consider applying again in the future.”</p><h2>‘Republican Party is broken’</h2><p>Sharing the email on Twitter, Love wrote: “Can’t make this sh** up lol!! I just watched [Turning Point USA founder] <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Kirk</a>, [political commentator] Dan Bongino, [GOP Senator] Rick Scott and [libertarian columnist] Kat Timpf speak about freedom, censorship, how inclusive the ‘movement’ is …etc…</p><p>“And then they had me thrown out of the Turning Point USA conference,” she wrote. “The Republican Party is broken.”</p><p>The legendary porn star later argued that she wasn’t attending the event to represent the porn industry.</p><p>“I was not there representing my profession. I was there as a citizen to be around other conservatives,” she tweeted.</p><p>“The entire opening was about Liberty, anti-cancel culture, inclusion etc. and then they unfortunately practiced the opposite,” Love added.</p><p>Earlier Saturday, Love had shared multiple videos to Twitter showing her excitement to be attending the event.</p><p>“It’s good to be around so many young conservatives. Gives me some hope!” she wrote in one message.</p><h2>An ‘egregious’ example of cancel culture</h2><p>Speaking to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Caller</a> on Sunday, Love called her ejection from the event “one of the more egregious” examples of cancel culture.</p><p>“PUSA literally opened the show talking about how we need to fight back against big tech censorship, cancel culture, the deterioration of our 1st Amendment etc.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Kirk</a> literally talked about making sacrifices as outspoken ‘conservatives.’ Something I’ve been for years at great risk and great loss. And then They expelled me. It’s hard to make that up. It’s a worst-case example of cancel culture.”</p><p>She went on to ask how conservatives expect to grow the GOP movement while excluding some members of society.</p><p>“It’s stupid to persecute people who have a different lifestyle than you. It’s stupid to throw out the baby with the bathwater,” she told the outlet.</p><p>“Include everyone in Constitutionally sound policy. That’s my idea about growth & returning Joy & unity amongst Americans.</p><p>“If TPUSA is the future, then the future is run by puritanical, fanatically devout Christians who will demand compliance or else. That’s a recipe for a shrinking party.”</p><h2>Turning Point USA defended decision</h2><p>In a statement, Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet defended the group’s actions.</p><p>“The Student Action Summit is a youth conference with 15- and 16-year-olds in attendance. As a matter of policy, TPUSA does not allow adult entertainers, influencers, or brands to participate in its events designed for minors,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a>.</p><p>“This was not a decision intended to be unkind to anyone, but in the interest of the student attendees in attendance, and their thousands of concerned parents.”</p><p>In addition to her work as an adult performer, Love is also a columnist for The Federalist, a conservative online magazine.</p><p>The outlet’s co-founder, Ben Domenech, has thrown his support behind Love and criticized Turning Point USA.</p><p>“I’m disappointed that @TPUSA kicked out @brandi_love for no reason whatsoever,” he tweeted.</p><p>“She’s a Florida conservative businesswoman who loves America. The right has an opportunity to be the big tent party. Don’t be a bunch of prudes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000666840084.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000666840085.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000666840080.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Trump is suing Facebook CEO Zuckerberg, Twitter’s Dorsey and Google boss and calls for end to ‘un-American’ cancel culture</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yuqqKbX5i8r7%2FEq62arJmrsm68zqulZquklr9urtGapZ2hXaG8t7GMn6ymnaNivK9507CgrayVp3qirs6uq2abkaOwpriMnKylrKWnsm6txa2cq2WjnbK0edSnoKeumamypXnFq6amZZekvW6%2F066bnqakYrK3sc2tZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charles-gaines-american-football.html><span>←</span><span>Charles Gaines Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
