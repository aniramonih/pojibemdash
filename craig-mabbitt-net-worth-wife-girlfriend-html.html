His full name is&nbsp;Craig Edward Mabbitt. There is not a lot of information on the singer’s family.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, it is undoubtedly clear that he loves his family a lot. His family frequently feature in his social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt height=583 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Craig-Mabbitt-Family.JPG width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Craig's Instagrams family photo on mother's birthday, 16 August 2018&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Craig Mabbitt's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Regarding his appearance, the singer&nbsp;is what many would call a lady's&nbsp;man.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>He has a well-toned body and a height of 5 feet 7 inch (1.68 m). Something else that everyone fancies about 32-year-old&nbsp;is his hairstyle. His new haircuts now and then remind his fans that he has every bit of the rockstar personality in him.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Music Career</h2><p style=text-align:justify>While Craig is a successful singer, it&nbsp;would be hard to believe he needed a breathing machine when he was young. He had severe asthma. Furthermore, he had to attend a particular class because of his speech disorder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, he overcame the setbacks. At the age of 16, in 2003, Craig joined Blessthefall.&nbsp;He was with the band for five years. He had two self-released EPs and one full-length album, His Last Walk. He parted ways with the band for personal reason in 2008, and&nbsp;Beau Bokan replaced him.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Celeb Who Also Left A Legendary Band:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Ron McGovney Wife, Net Worth, Now" rel=follow>Ron McGovney Wife, Net Worth, Now</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After leaving Blessthefall, Craig formed his band, The Word Alive.

Although his net worth remains confined to the public, it is undoubtedly in the range of millions due to his accomplishments.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Craig Married? Wife & Children</h2><p style=text-align:justify>When it comes to rock stars or just high profile celebrities in general, their personal life is a complicated mess. Craig is no exception.&nbsp;Craig had his first child when he was just a teenager at the age of 17. Details on whom he had the baby with and on the baby is not public information. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Other than that, he was in a relationship with&nbsp;Gabrielle Frosinos in the late 2000s. The couple's&nbsp;consummation led to the birth of&nbsp;a daughter, Leila Rose and a son,&nbsp;Caige Michael-Edward.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Leila is the oldest. She was born on the 27th of October 2006 while Caige was born on the 5th of November 2013.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>No Women In Life:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Sam Smith Gay, Boyfriend, Dating, Weight Loss" rel=follow>Sam Smith Gay, Boyfriend, Dating, Weight Loss</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>After the split, the couple went their separate way.
