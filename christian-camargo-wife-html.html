But to fans' surprise, they are no longer together.&nbsp;Instead, Camargo is now a parent to his son with his new partner. So what happened to Camargo and his wife?&nbsp;</p><h2>Christian Camargo's Relationship with Ex Wife Juliet Rylance&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Camargo met his wife, Rylance, in 1997 when he was in London for movie production. He was 26 years old, and she was only 18 then.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Rylance had a three-day crush on him, but they remained friends. Later in March 2008, they decided to meet while she was in New York. They started dating immediately.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Camargo was in love and serious about her. He proposed to her twice before she said yes on the third attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>They chose to get married on the closing night of Cameron's play&nbsp;All My Sons&nbsp;in November 2008. They were accompanied by his co-stars,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>John Lithgow</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Dianne Wiest</a>, who sang them a wedding song.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As a child, Rylance imagined being married in front of hundreds of friends with a big carriage taking her to the big party. But with Camargo, she was happiest with her small city hall marriage. "I realize the marriage is more important than the wedding," she said to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">New Yorker</a>&nbsp;in 2010.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After the marriage, Rylance moved to America. They adopted a dog, Garth, in 2016, settled in Joshua Tree, California, and had a home in London.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Unfortunately, they have apparently divorced. Camargo has moved on to a new partner.</p><h2>Christian Camargo and Girlfriend Have a Son</h2><p>Since 2019, Camargo has been dating Dutch model and bags designer Sylvia van der Klooster. The couple announced they were pregnant with their first child on July 1, 2019. Klooster shared a hued picture of her growing bump on her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The couple has not provided details of their relationship, but they are seen often traveling on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>They became parents to their first child, Elan, on November 19. Camargo made a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">heartfelt post</a>&nbsp;of his son's birthing, awed with Klooster's "bionic superpowers."</p><p class=image-align-center></p><p><strong>Camargo and his new partner, Sylvia van der Klooster, are parents to their son, Elan.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Christian Camargo/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In the post, Camargo also gave the reason behind naming his son Elan. He said, "Elan, there are multiple interpretations to your name: Tree, enthusiasm, and (my favorite) friend. Elan Jacobus Camargo aka “Buddy.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Camargo also pours love on his new partner on his Instagram. He named her 'my queen,' and on 2022 Mother's Day, he said she was the 'best mama' Elan could have.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuYp7a0wMiapWabkaKus7POZq6inpVjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celia-meiras-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Celia Meiras Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
