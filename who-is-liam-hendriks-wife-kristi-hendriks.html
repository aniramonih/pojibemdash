His remarkable journey from an underdog to a star player is a testament to his resilience, determination, and unwavering passion for the game. Who is his wife, Kristi Hendriks?</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Liam Hendriks was born on February 10, 1989, in Perth, Australia. He displayed an early affinity for baseball. However, growing up in a country where cricket and Australian rules football reign supreme, he faced an uphill battle in pursuing his dreams of playing professional baseball.</p><p>Undeterred by the lack of baseball infrastructure in Australia, he worked tirelessly to hone his skills. He played in local leagues and participated in various tournaments, catching the attention of scouts from the Minnesota Twins. In 2007, at the age of 18, he signed with the Twins as an undrafted free agent.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His professional career got off to a promising start.

His breakthrough came in 2011 when he made his MLB debut for the Twins, becoming the first Australian-born player to start a game as a pitcher in the majors.</p><p>Although he exhibited flashes of brilliance, Hendriks struggled to find consistency at the highest level. He bounced between the Twins and their minor league affiliates, battling injuries and experiencing setbacks along the way. Despite the challenges, he never lost sight of his ultimate goal.</p><p>In 2014, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals, marking a new chapter in his career. However, it wasn’t until 2015 when he joined the Toronto Blue Jays that he began to truly make his mark. Transitioning to a relief role, Hendriks found his groove, delivering strong performances out of the bullpen. His pitching prowess played a crucial role in the Blue Jays’ deep playoff run that year, as they advanced to the American League Championship Series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following his stint with the Blue Jays, he had brief stints with the Oakland Athletics and the Chicago Cubs before finding his true calling with the Chicago White Sox. In the 2019 season, he emerged as a dominant closer, posting a minuscule 1.80 ERA and recording 25 saves. His remarkable consistency continued into the 2020 season, where he played a pivotal role in leading the White Sox to the playoffs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Hendriks’ success on the field goes beyond statistics. His vibrant personality and leadership qualities have made him a beloved figure among teammates and fans alike. He brings an infectious energy to the game, often celebrated for his passionate celebrations after securing a crucial save. Off the field, he is known for his philanthropy, supporting various charitable causes and making a positive impact in his community.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding performances, Hendriks received numerous accolades. He was named an All-Star in 2019 and 2020 and won the American League Reliever of the Year Award in both seasons. In addition, he became the first Australian-born player to earn a save in the MLB All-Star Game, further solidifying his place among the game’s elite.</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Meet Ike Turner Jr biological mother, Lorraine Taylor</a></p><h2><strong>Liam Hendriks Wife</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Liam Hendriks is happily married to his wife, Kristi Hendriks.
