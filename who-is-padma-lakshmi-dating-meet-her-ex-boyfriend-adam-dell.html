Though the celeb chef and the venture capitalist haven’t announced their split, Padma was spotted kissing another man in June 2021.</p><p><a href=#>Page Six</a> published photos of the <a href=#>Top Chef</a> star holding hands with an unidentified mystery man, who was <a href=#>later revealed</a> to be <strong>Terrance Hayes</strong>, while walking her dog in New York City. Padma looked happier than ever as she gave the American poet a smooch at one point during their outing.</p><p>The lovey-dovey snapshots come as a surprise to fans considering many assumed Padma was still dating Adam. However, a source told Page Six the former lovebirds “broke up shortly after the new year.”</p><p>“It was very amicable,” the insider explained, noting Padma and Adam “are intent on staying the best of friends and remain like family” for the sake of their only child together. “[They] are still very close and are committed to coparenting their <a href=#>daughter, Krishna,</a> who has always been their first priority.”</p><p>Padma’s team did not immediately respond to Closer Weekly‘s request for comment.​​​</p><p>Since 2009, Padma has been romantically involved with Adam, though they called it quits a few times over the course of their decade-long relationship. The exes met two years after Padma divorced her ex-husband, <strong>Salman Rushdie</strong>, in 2007, and they started a family when they welcomed Krishna in 2010.</p><p>The Love, Loss, and What We Ate author and Adam split before Krisha’s birth, however, and they were involved in a tumultuous custody battle until it was settled in 2012. After spending the next five years apart, <a href=#>Page Six</a> reported Padma and Adam were back together by 2017.</p><p>Things appeared to be better than ever for the duo, and in 2019, many speculated they were taking things to the next level when Padma was spotted with a diamond ring during an outing with her beau. Despite sporting the oval-shaped sparkler on that finger, the star’s reps denied rumors of an engagement.</p><p>Still, Padma and Adam stayed together throughout 2020, with the Tomatoes for Neela author uploading sweet photos of the ex-couple and their daughter while <a href=#>celebrating her 50th birthday</a> in September. Padma said although the year was filled with “misery,” she was grateful to have Adam and Krishna.</p><p>“We made a cocoon for our family. We lived for the first time all under one roof,” she penned. “We became closer … I am truly blessed: a loving and attentive partner, a child that continues to be a miracle every day and work that I am proud of and fully engaged by with people I love.”</p><p><strong>To learn more about Padma’s ex-boyfriend, scroll through the gallery below for fun facts on Adam!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6sa3DpphmpJGgwKm5yGabmqyZo7RuucSeq2aglad6psSMm6aynqKesq%2BwjJqbmqVdmbKtuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-fayza-lamari-all-about-kylian-mbappes-mother-and-agent.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Fayza Lamari?
