Endless speculations have arisen about his ethnicity, birthplace, parents, and age. Let’s delve into the facts straight away. The 35-year-old combat sports athlete is of Asian-American descent.</p><p>Asa’s parents have been his constant support throughout his life, from his early years to his professional debut. His father, in particular, has played a significant role in his accomplishments. Asa Ten Pow, also known as ‘The American Ninja,’ quickly made a name for himself in ONE Championship since his debut in 2021. Based in Palm Beach County, Florida, Asa Ten Pow is the founder of Florida Kickboxing Academy. He stands out as one of the prominent figures in American Muay Thai athletes, with over three decades of experience in various combat sports including Muay Thai, MMA, Boxing, and Kung Fu.</p><h2>Asa Ten Pow: Wiki & Age</h2><p><strong>Asa Ten Pow</strong> was born in Portland, Oregon in 1989 to his father, <strong>Jerry Ten Pow, and mother, Linda Ten Pow</strong>. Although he comes from a mixed background, with an Asian father and an American mother, he is a naturalized American. Asa, described as undersized by doctors in his childhood, was introduced to karate by his mother to build confidence and protect him from bullies.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Asa-Ten-Pow-1.jpg alt="Asa Ten Pow" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He began practicing karate at the age of five, and later relocated to South Florida with his father, Jerry Ten Pow, following his parents’ separation. The reasons behind their divorce remain undisclosed at this time.</p><h2>Asa Ten Pow’s Ethnicity and the Influence of His Father</h2><p>Jerry Ten Pow enrolled his son in Kung Fu classes alongside older opponents and introduced him to other combat sports such as Kickboxing, Muay Thai, and Wing Chun. Asa graduated from Royal Palm Beach High School and continued his martial arts training. His father has been a guiding force in his success. Despite Asa’s interest in American Football during his teenage years, his father kept him focused on martial arts, believing it to be his true calling. Jerry closely monitored his son’s progress and played a crucial role in shaping Asa’s career as a professional combat sports athlete.</p><p>When Asa turned 18, he aimed to prove to his father that he could excel in martial arts on his own. His debut in ONE Championship on October 21, 2021, marked a pinnacle in his career. Asa recently claimed victory against Rambolek of Thailand in Round 3 of ONE Championship Fight Night 14. The fruit of his successful competitive career was a testament to Jerry’s influence. However, Asa Ten Pow’s father, who was instrumental in his achievement, passed away a few years ago under undisclosed circumstances.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Asa-Ten-Pow.jpg alt="Asa Ten Pow" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Asa Ten Pow’s Relationship Journey</h2><p>‘The American Ninja’ is married to his long-term partner Tavia Roman.
