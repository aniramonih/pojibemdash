If you can believe it, John Travolta was not one of the 1.7 million people who watched the premiere of HBO's documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.

As for this interview… it reads like Mid-Life Crisis Monthly, quite honestly.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Leslie Bibb Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 7, 2024</time>
