Johnnie Taylor Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴Last night I dreamed I was at a concert
So many people, you had to stand in line
One night only in Soul Heaven
I didn't wanna wake up
I was having such a good time
All of The Bar-Kays were tuning up on stage
Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play
Sam was singing &#34;A Change Gonna Come&#34;"><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The first verse sets the scene, describing the crowded concert lineup that the singer came across, with all of The Bar-Kays tuning up on stage, Jimi Hendrix getting ready to play, and Sam Cooke singing "A Change Gonna Come" while Otis Redding was sittin' at the dock of the bay. The second verse continues with the fun that the concert attendees were having, dancing and practically standing on their chairs in excitement as Jr. Walker performed, and enthusiastically cheering on Jackie Wilson, Sammy Davis Jr., and Z.Z. Hill as they gave their performances. The third verse brings on the big names, with Ella Fitzgerald and Mahalia Jackson making an appearance backstage alongside Elvis Presley with his blue suede shoes. There's even mention of the fresh rain that fell near the end of the concert, which didn't stop the attendees from staying put to hear the amazing Z.Z. Hill give an encore performance of "Down Home Blues." The final verse really brings the show of legends to a finale, where greats like Al Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and King Curtis filled the stage, and Tupac and Biggie were the ones who closed the show, eventually leading the singer to wonder whether it was even real or a beautiful dream.</p><br><p>"Soul Heaven" is a heartwarming tribute to R&B and soul legends, and is perfect as a feel-good anthem, providing the listener an escape into a beautiful dream world. The lyrics reflect the joy that these icons have brought to the masses and how even in death they have continued to inspire generations of music lovers. Upbeat and reminiscent, the song is also full of references that any soul music fan would enjoy.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Last night I dreamed I was at a concert</u><br>The singer is dreaming about being at a concert</p><br><p><u>So many people, you had to stand in line</u><br>The concert was very popular, and a lot of people had to wait in line to get in</p><br><p><u>One night only in Soul Heaven</u><br>The concert was a one-time event in a place called Soul Heaven</p><br><p><u>I didn't wanna wake up</u><br>The artist was enjoying the dream so much they didn't want it to end</p><br><p><u>I was having such a good time</u><br>The artist was enjoying the concert dream</p><br><p><u>All of The Bar-Kays were tuning up on stage</u><br>The Bar-Kays were preparing to play music on stage</p><br><p><u>Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play</u><br>Jimi Hendrix was preparing to play his guitar on stage</p><br><p><u>Sam was singing 'A Change Gonna Come'</u><br>Sam Cooke was singing his famous song 'A Change Gonna Come'</p><br><p><u>Otis was there, sittin' at the dock of the bay</u><br>Otis Redding was present, perhaps recalling his hit song 'Sitting on the Dock of the Bay'</p><br><p><u>There was a party in Soul Heaven</u><br>The concert was like a party in Soul Heaven</p><br><p><u>Superstars from the past</u><br>The artists performing at the concert were deceased and considered legends</p><br><p><u>Standing room only, so you better hurry</u><br>The concert was so popular that there was only standing room left, so one should hurry to get in</p><br><p><u>Train & Miles (J.
