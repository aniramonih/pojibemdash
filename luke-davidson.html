Young and energetic Luke graduated from Dauphin Regional Secondary School in 2021 and has even posted a <a href=# rel=noopener>picture</a> of the day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2>From Thinking That Tiktok Is Cringy to Being One of the Popular Creators on the Platform</h2><p>Just like many of us, 18-year-old Luke also thought that making Tiktok was embarrassing. When he actually wanted to make one, he made an account using his cat's name Rory so that no one would know who he really is. Little did the Canadian Tiktok star know, it was the accelerator of his career as a social media personality.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The 5'10" tall video creator downloaded Tiktok because it was famous among his friends and decided to make one just because he was bored. His first video which was under the sound "Have you ever looked at someone and thought what goes on in their mind" got thousands of views overnight. Though shy and embarrassed at first, this motivated him to post 2-3 more videos. Eventually, the blue-eyed Tiktoker is now a famous social media personality.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Luke-Davidson-TikTok-Cringe.jpg alt="Luke Davidson making a TikTok videowith the ring light on a stand." width=720 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>We see what he meant...</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Luke Davidson, Instagram</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Well known for his comedy skits, pranks, and hilariously relatably videos, Luke is now a popular figure on Tiktok (<a href=# rel=noopener>lukedavidson_</a>).
