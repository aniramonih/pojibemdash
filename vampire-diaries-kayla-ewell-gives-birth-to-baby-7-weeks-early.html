Trevino, 37, was also on TVD with Ewell, where they played Tyler Lockwood and Vicki Donovan, respectively, and he wasn’t the only Vampire Diaries actor to congratulate her in the comments section.</p><p>Former leading lady<a href=#> <strong>Nina Dobrev</strong></a> (who portrayed doppelgängers Elena Gilbert and Katherine Pierce) gushed, “That little hand!”</p><p>Actress <strong>Sara Canning</strong> (who appeared as Jenna Gilbert) added, “Oh goodness!

How it grows, changes and knows exactly what it needs to do. Proud of all the mama’s out there and excited to join the club.”</p><p>Before welcoming Jones, the California native revealed that her baby bump was written into her role on ABC’s The Rookie. “As an actor it’s not often you’re pregnancy is written into a role. Huge thank you to all the writers and producers of @therookieabc for embracing motherhood,” she shared via Instagram in May. “What a constant joy it is to work on this show. If you missed this week’s episode, it’s now streaming on @hulu.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGavmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBut8Cyo5pllayyrbiMoKCvnaNir6q%2B06Fkraddl66jxYxwZLCdlaDAbrHAq6OyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tye-tribbett.html><span>←</span><span>Tye Tribbett- Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</span></a>
