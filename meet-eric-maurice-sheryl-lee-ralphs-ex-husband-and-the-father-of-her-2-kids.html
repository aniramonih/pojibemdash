His exact date and year of birth are not revealed to the public but a few sources have reported that Eric must be in his middle 60s. So, if the information is anything to go by, then he was born between 1957 and 1959.</p><p>Nothing is known about his early life, parents, siblings, and family background in general. However, records have it that the businessman though born in Abidjan has lived in several countries including France, Ireland, Switzerland, Martinique, and Italy, and currently resides in Los Angeles California. Similarly, there is no information recorded about his academic background.</p><p>The fact is, Eric Maurice only came to media recognition recently given how much fame his ex-wife Sheryl has gathered over the years. Besides his marriage to the actress, Eric does not have any public personality or celebrity status, unlike Sheryl his ex-wife. Also, the fact that it has been a long time since their marriage ended makes it more difficult to get details information about him</p><p>About what he does for a living, Eric Maurice is recognized as an international businessman, entrepreneur, and trendsetter, and a member of Soka Gakkai International. He is said to be traveling around the world in style with his uncommon taste for high-end living. Details of his kind of business are not revealed.</p><h2><strong>He Was Sheryl Lee Ralph’s Husband for 11 Years</strong></h2><p>While it is not known exactly when and where Eric Maurice met his actress ex-wife Sheryl Lee Ralph, it is quite clear that the ex-couple got married in 1990. Meanwhile, before their marriage happened, the actress once revealed that she was used to wearing a string on her finger as an indication that she needs to pay attention to her own life.</p><p>She made this decision during one of her birthday parties when she noticed that she was the only one at the party without a partner, while the rest of the attendants made merry in pairs. However, it was long before Eric met her and replaced the string with a diamond ring and she couldn’t have been happier.</p><p>Eric Maurice married Sheryl Lee Ralph in 1990 in a white wedding ceremony in Los Angeles. The couple seemed to be living happily together until after 11 years when the news of their divorce broke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Eric-Maurice-and-ex-wife-Sheryl.jpg><h2><b>They Divorced in 2001 amid Torrie Tabloid Allegations&nbsp;</b></h2><p>When a couple falls in love and walks down the aisle, they always hope that their union lasts forever, but, that is not always the case- a situation Eric and his ex-wife know too well. Rumors about their split started circulating in 2000, a year before they finalized their divorce.</p><p>National Enquirer published an article with the headline, ”Moesha’ TV Mom Splits With Hubby” containing numerous false and despicable statements. The couple had wanted it done amicably and out of the public eye but the tabloid made it impossible after publishing the article.</p><p>The magazine which the star actress would later sue made claims that Sheryl was leaving her husband so she could chase after younger men. While those remain false statements and allegations, the lawsuit established that the couple was actually going through a divorce. They finalized their divorce in 2001 and went their separate ways.</p><p>Eric Maurice and Sheryl later sued National Enquirer for $1 million in Los Angeles Superior Court for libel and invasion of privacy. Sheryl subsequently disclosed in an interview that the divorce caused her depression and self-doubt.</p><p>On his own side, Eric never disclosed how he felt regarding the crash of his marriage or the cause of the split. Eric Maurice and Sheryl Lee Ralph may have gotten divorced because they fell out of love. It could also be for another reason.</p><h3><strong>Eric Maurice Has Two Children from his Marriage to Ralph</strong></h3><p>Eric Maurice’s marriage with his ex-wife Sheryl Lee Ralph produced two children; a son named Etienne Maurice and a daughter named Ivy Victoria Maurice. Etienne was born in 1992 while Ivy was born in 1995. Etienne and Ivy Victoria are currently 31 and 28 years old respectively.</p><p>Just like his mother, Etienne is involved in the film industry. He is a filmmaker and director in his own right and is the founder of Walk Good Productions in Los Angeles. He has a few acting and directing credits and is mostly known for his work on “H.E.I.R.” and “Hideous”</p><p>His sister Ivy Victoria is a digital creator and the Vice President of his film company, Walk Good Productions. This simply means that the two siblings share a close bond not only as siblings but also co-workers. Victoria is also the creative director of&nbsp; WalkGood Wear.</p><p>Although they are closer with their mom, Etienne and Ivy also have obviously maintained a very close bond with their father as is evident from their Instagram posts. They occasionally feature him in their feed and in one of Victoria’s posts, she acknowledged her father for setting the bar high for her future suitors by buying her chocolate and roses and taking her out every Valentine’s Day.</p><p>Etienne also paid tribute to his father on fathers day with adorable father-son photos captioned; “Happy Father’s Day Pops! Blessed to have you in my life.”</p><h3><strong>Eric Hasn’t Remarried Since His Divorce From Sheryl</strong></h3><p>Following their divorce, Sheryl Ralph found love again in the arms of Vincent Hughes, Pennsylvania State Senator.
