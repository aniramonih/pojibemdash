<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Jason Tartick: How Kaitlyn Hookup Story Led to Me Leaving Banking</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>An unfiltered love story! <a href=#><strong>Jason Tartick</strong></a> was given an ultimatum by his previous employer after <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> shared a candid story about their first hookup — and he’s spilling all the details in his new book, <a href=#>The Restart Roadmap</a>.</p><p>“I was put in this ultimatum. I asked permission to go on [The Bachelorette]. A lot of people wonder, like, ‘How do you go on a reality show and have a real job?’ Well, the memo for me doing so and the story is told right in the book,” the 33-year-old author<a href=#> said in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly,</a> noting that he went back to his corporate job after coming in third on <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a>’s season. “But then I’m put in this ultimatum and this ultimatum really put me in the back of a corner and it was all stemmed from a PG-13 rated comment from Kaitlyn.”</p><p>Tartick, who has been linked to Bristowe since January 2019, worked as a banker before he started hosting his podcast, “Trading Secrets,” and founded his company, Restart Consulting.</p><p>“<a href=#>Kaitlyn’s podcast, ‘Off the Vine’</a> — as you guys know — she has confessions and the idea behind her confessions is to say, ‘Those people you look up to, those people that you might follow, those people that put a smile on your face, those same people experience embarrassing moments all the time. And so when you come on ‘Off the Vine,’ tell us a moment that makes you relatable.’ Her confession was that [was] the first time we hooked up, <a href=#>she had an orgasm from dry-humping,</a>” Tartick recalled. “That confession hit a lot of headlines and made its way back to the office.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jason-Tartick-Reveals-the-NSFW-Story-Told-by-Kaitlyn-Bristowe-That-Lost-Him-His-Banking-Job.jpg><p>The entrepreneur told Us that the podcast episode “sparked the conversation” for him to officially leave his banking job.</p><p>“They said either restart your career in the bank and no more side hustle — no more interviews, no more podcasts, no more social media, nothing, everything [would have] to be approved by us or go restart yourself outside of the bank,” the Bachelorette season 14 alum told Us. “And not only did I restart myself, but I built a company because of that called Restart to help people do the same — refine their career navigation and really work on personal finance. And I feel like from my stories, I can make an impact and that’s what I’m trying to do. Just make the slightest impact for people to write their own story.”</p><p>Tartick and Bristowe went on to get engaged in 2021.</p><p>“I’ll never forget when I called my brother who is a business owner himself, and said, ‘Steve, what do I do here?’ He said, ‘I have a friend I’m gonna call to talk to you — he was a New York City attorney,” Tartick told Us. “He said, ‘I’ve heard a lot of stories about bankers and Wall Street. I have to say, this is the first story I’m getting where someone didn’t say anything and it was a consensual clothed sexual interaction that a partner told in a lighthearted way.'”</p><p>Tartick added that he “adores” his fiancée for her openness.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Kaitlyn is open and honest and real, and that’s what’s led to so much of her success. I was ready to make that move outside [of the banking world] pretty soon. I don’t think I planned for it to be just that soon, but it all worked out,” he said with a laugh.</p><p>The Restart Roadmap, which hits shelves on April 5, is available for preorder.</p><p>“There’s a lot of how-to career books out there. So the goal was to keep it entertaining, engaging and with every single chapter there to be actionable takeaways, which there are,” he told Us. “It’s a guide for anyone that’s rethinking their profession [or] making the slightest adjustments, like, negotiating for themselves with their bosses within their work environment or the most material move as far as changing an industry completely [leaving] your job. But I do it through engaging storytelling and from my experience behind-the-scenes of unscripted television to the offices of some of Forbes‘ most powerful people [on Wall Street]. There’s a lot of lessons to be learned and this is an eight-step process that will help people do just that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGaq5%2BjerWt0a2gnKNdnby4ecqaoK2kqaN6qbvOpKypZaOpvLPFjKWcnWWkpHqusYylnJqumaO0bq7Ap6Kippdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./january-jokes-for-kids.html><span>←</span><span>January Jokes for Kids Plus, Winter Jokes for Kids</span></a>
