The family claimed that Yahshua Robinson’s death was caused in part by the school’s negligence.</p><p>Amarna Plummer, Yahshua’s aunt, told NBC Los Angeles that her nephew was forced to do laps in the sweltering heat as a punishment for not dressing properly for P.E. class. The family asserted that Yahshua repeatedly alerted the teacher to his distress while on the run, despite being in excruciating bodily pain.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The teacher allegedly ignored the boy’s protests up until his heat stroke led to his passing out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Yahshua’s mother, a P.E. teacher at a separate school in the district, is also accused by Plummer of having cautioned Yahshua’s school administration about the dangers of holding courses outside in the sweltering heat. She stated:</p><p>“She informs the administration, ‘Do not let any children go out today for P.E.’ And what happened? She gets a call that he passed out on the field.”</p><p>A Lake Elsinore Unified School District representative expressed their sorrow at the student’s passing and said Yahshua “exhibited bodily distress.” In a letter distributed to district residents, it was stated: “Our teaching staff took prompt action to address the student and called emergency services, who were on campus within minutes. I provide this information to emphasise to our students and families that if ever a student were to demonstrate a need for attention, we will respond promptly to their needs and we will contact the family.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-his-school-issue-any-statement><strong>Did his School issue any statement?</strong></h2><p>The school has declined to make any other comments, including on whether the incident was being looked into as a result of the family’s complaints.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Source: <a href=#>www.ghbase.com</a></p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx5qrZqCRpb2musSdZK2nXa6uqb%2FHrphmqp%2BXtq%2B%2FzqdkqK6Vp3p1hI9pZ2aqkZ7AprCMqKVmn5%2Bbwq%2BwzJ5kmqtdoa6ssYyeo6yhnqS%2FpnnMopudpJViwKS0zqijZpqfrnqltcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./line-of-duty-vicky-mcclure-wedding-dress-second-look-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Vicky McClures bridal dress quest and standout second wedding look - exclusive</span></a>
