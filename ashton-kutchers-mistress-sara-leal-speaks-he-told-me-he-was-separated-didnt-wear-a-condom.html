At that time Brittany said that Ashton told her that “<a href=#>he and Demi have an open relationship</a> and have threesomes often,” in order to justify their hookup, which in no way involved Demi. (That we know of.) It looks like Ashton has changed his pickup line, because he told his latest mistress that he and Demi were separated. Sara Leal is the party girl who slept with Ashton at the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego on what would have been his sixth anniversary about two and a half weeks ago. So far we’ve heard the story of that night<a href=#> from “sources”</a> and <a href=#>from Sara’s “friend,”</a> who confirmed that Sara and Ashton “definitely boned.” A couple of outlets met Sara’s asking price for an interview, and she just spoke to <a href=#>US Weekly</a> and to <a href=#>British rag The Sun</a> about her night with Ashton. In fact Sara takes the cover of US this week and it looks like she got fresh extensions for the occasion. A lot of the crap that Sara claims Ashton told her made me cringe. She also claimed that they didn’t use protection. Gross.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/sara2.jpg alt=sara2 title=sara2 width=483 height=313 sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>US Weekly: He was tender, they didn’t use a condom</strong><br>In the new Us Weekly, the 22-year-old San Diego-based administrative assistant breaks her silence about the fateful early morning of Sept. 24 — Kutcher’s six-year anniversary with wife Demi Moore — when she had sex with the actor, 33, following a wild, all-night party in his suite at San Diego’s Hard Rock Hotel.</p><p>“He just came up and kissed me,” the Texas native tells Us of Kutcher’s first bold move in the wee hours; minutes later, Leal, Kutcher and another young woman were completely nude and in a hot tub on the balcony.</p><p>“I didn’t think it was out of the ordinary,” Leal admits. “I wasn’t self-conscious about getting naked.”</p><p>When Kutcher claimed that he was “separated” from wife Moore, 48, Leal tells Us she believed him.</p><p>After retreating to Kutcher’s bedroom past 6 a.m., “he lost his towel and I took my robe off,” Leal says. “Then we had sex.”</p><p>“He was good,” Leal reveals. “It wasn’t weird or perverted.” It also wasn’t 100 percent safe, either: Leal tells Us that Kutcher did not wear a condom during their one-on-one encounter.</p><p>The post-coital talk was a little unexpected, she confesses; the duo talked astrology (they’re both Aquarius), religion, love, even politics. “I told him I was a Lutheran from Texas. He said, ‘Oh my gosh! Are you a Republican?'” Leal says.</p><p>Democratic-leaning Kutcher quizzed her on “up-and-coming candidates. I said Rick Perry. He asked if I’d vote for him. I said I didn’t know and he laughed. He laughed at pretty much everything I said.”</p><p>But it wasn’t all twenty questions between the lovers, according to Leal. After having sex for a second time — and arguing over Leal’s cell phone — the married Two and a Half Men star was tender.</p><p>“He was like, ‘I enjoy things like this because I’m an actor 90 percent of the time and it’s fake. It’s nice to have moments that are real,'” Leal recalls.</p><strong>The Sun: Ashton wanted a threesome, checked out her body afterwards</strong><br>Speaking to The Sun newspaper, Sara described how she had sex twice with the 33-year-old actor.<p>She said: ‘We had sex twice. Everything felt natural. We were having a good time. He was good, but it wasn’t weird or perverted or creepy.</p><p>‘He had good endurance. We were up for a while. It was about two hours.’</p><p>Leal described how earlier in the night he had kissed her and her friend Marta on the bed of his hotel room.</p><p>‘I’m sure he wanted to have a threesome,’ she said. ‘It was clear he wasn’t opposed to it.’</p><p>Sara said there were around 20 revellers partying with Kutcher in his lavish suite, drinking vodka, tequila and beer.</p><p>Most of the guests left at around 5am, leaving Kutcher with Sara and some of her girlfriends.</p><p>Leal claims they then all jumped in the hot tub naked, saying: ‘Ashton looked hot naked.’</p><p>When one of Sara’s friends asked if Kutcher was married, Leal claims he replied: ‘I am separated’.</p><p>After the hot tub session, Sara and friend Marta ended up in Kutcher’s bed – but Marta left after a short while leaving Kutcher alone with Sara.</p><p>‘The last thing I remember him saying was he did a good job. We woke up and I wearing a robe.</p><p>‘He opened it up and I was like “What are you doing?” He was like, “Just checking. Ok, I did good. You’re really pretty.'”</p><p>[From <a href=#>US Weekly</a> and The Sun via <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>]</p><p>Yes she’s “22” and an “administrative assistant” from a small town in Texas. She just happened to be there that night, and to be playing the press perfectly after boning Ashton. The article in the Daily Mail has more about Ashton and Demi’s big camping weekend with Kabbalah counselors that <a href=#>Kaiser covered yesterday</a>. I knew that it was Yom Kippur last weekend, but I didn’t realize that it was a special day of atonement in the Jewish religion. (I’m a little slow on the uptake and I tend to ignore anything having to do with religion.) To me that means that Demi could be using her faith to justify taking Ashton back. She’s probably heartbroken, really wants it to work and is pushing him to stay in the marriage. It’s hard to say whether Ashton wants to stay or not. I’ve seen guys cheat who are conflicted at leaving their wives and don’t want to give up the stable easy home life while they get some strange on the side. Demi needs to face it, though, Ashton has been doing this for a while. These are the two women that he’s cheated with that we know of. There are surely plenty more.</p><p>Ashton sent a tweet to Demi, finally, wishing her luck with something. He also changed the background of <a href=#>his Twitter accoun</a> to <a href=#>this weird clock</a> with emotion names listed where the numbers should be. At 12 is “epiphany,” followed by “anxiety,” “duty,” “guilt,” “indifference,” etc. Ashton’s was pointing to “anxiety” and “fear.” He doesn’t know what the hell he wants.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3523668-953x1024.jpg alt=wenn3523668 title=wenn3523668 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 953px) 100vw, 953px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3523676-791x1024.jpg alt=wenn3523676 title=wenn3523676 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Ashton is shown with Jon Cryer while Cryer gets a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 9/19/11.
