Our campus community mourns her tragic loss. We send our heartfelt condolences to her family, friends, classmates and all those who knew her.”</p><p><strong>WJ Heal also shared the sad news on Facebook writing</strong>;</p><p>“When I got the call last Saturday that my friend’s 22 year old daughter had died in a skiing accident, I thought, “Please God, let this not be true.” T.J. Sheahan started as a student of mine at DePaul Law School and became a dear friend. He even was the chairman of my campaign for the bench. Later, when his wife Patti ran for judge I took the photos for her campaign literature (the people running the Chicago Cultural Center kicked us out because I had Patti standing atop a chair to get a better photo.). T.J. and Patti are part of a large Irish brood who have been very kind to me over the years. I did not know their beautiful daughter Eileen but I know how much she is loved and will be missed. And I know that the Sheahan family is surrounded by the love of an amazing community of friends and family. I sent T.J. my favorite poem about loved ones departing which he shared with his family. Rest well young lady. The brightness of your life will never dim in our hearts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hksJmjYrKquMSepWarmJquqa3NZp2uppWnrq15w56rmqGcqHqzsdWemKWdlGKutHnUp6CvnaKotrXFjKidZqWZmLWqs8CnZKyspZmyr8CMnaCeq12WtKawjGtpaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrew-putnam-wife-who-is-tawny-frans-putnam.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tawny Frans Putnam?</span></a>
