But it wasn’t until she was 15 that she made the brave choice to audition for a Spanish singing competition show called Tu Si Que Vales. Unfortunately, things did not work out for her – yet.</p><p>Here’s a comment of one of the judges in the show:</p><p>“I think you’ve got a lot of potential but you have yet to learn how to harness it.”</p><p>Well, it’s safe to say that Rosalia definitely took heed to that advice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=What_is_Rosalias_Height><strong>What is Rosalia’s Height?</strong></span></h2><p>It’s hard to say just how tall Rosalia is especially since we’ve never seen her measured. But, some sources estimate that<strong> Rosalia is around 5ft4 to 5ft5 tall, which is 162cm to 165cm.</strong> Compared to the average height of Hispanic women, Rosalia is actually pretty tall.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve done some research and found out that Rosalia is as tall as these celebrities:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Who_are_Rosalias_Parents><strong>Who are Rosalia’s Parents?</strong></span></h2><p>Rosalia was born to two Spanish native parents, Maria Pilar Tobella and Jose Manuel Vila. According to Rosalia herself, her family had zero background in the music industry. That is why she had to work extra hard to make her dreams come true.</p><p>Even though her family was limited in their capacity to make sure their daughter had the resources she needed to become successful, they still showered Rosalia with unconditional support.</p><p>Her mom even quit her day job to become Rosalia’s business manager. That might explain why Rosalia has decided to keep her family’s life private from the unforgiving and often crazy world that she now lives in.&nbsp;</p><p>She isn’t pictured with her parents that often, but we’d like to think that they still keep their lines open for communication.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Does_Rosalia_Have_a_Sibling><strong>Does Rosalia Have a Sibling?</strong></span></h2><p>As it turns out, Rosalia does have a sister named Pili Vila Tobella. She’s been her sister’s number one fan ever since and has never failed to let Rosalia know how proud she is of her.</p><p>She’s done many things for Rosalia, including working as her personal stylist and creative consultant. Moreover, Rosalia revealed that it was her sister who gave her the news about her five <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grammy</a> nominations. Apparently, Pili gave Rosalia a balloon with a number five on it. How cute!</p><p>Rosalia disclosed that fashion has made her closer to her sister:</p><p>“Playing with clothes, taking pictures has always been our way of having fun.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=What_is_Rosalias_Net_Worth><strong>What is Rosalia’s Net Worth?</strong></span></h2><p>As one of the biggest rising stars in the Latin music industry, Rosalia is reported to be sitting on a multimillion dollar fortune. According to several sources, Rosalia’s<strong> net worth is estimated to be around $5million.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>But she doesn’t like keeping it all to herself, though. Throughout her career, Rosalia has been known for being generous and participating in philanthropic endeavors.</p><p>She has donated in several charities, partnered with the world’s biggest brands for a good cause, and engaged in advocacies aimed towards women empowerment and gender equality.</p><p>So, now you know everything there is to know about Rosalia!
