Playing 25 shows in 21 cities from June 23 to August 22, Guns N' Roses made </span><b>$116.8 million</b><span style=font-weight:400>. That's an average of about $4.68 million PER SHOW.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Add in a couple of April shows earlier this year, plus appearances at Coachella Music Festival and two shows at the Foro Sol in Mexico, and GnR has made more than $132 million this year. They're also scheduled to play 11 shows in Latin America this fall, and have Asian and Australian dates lined up for early next year. When all is said and done, this tour could bring in more than $200 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is the first time Guns N' Roses members </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Axl Rose</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Slash</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Duff McKagan</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> have appeared onstage together since 1993. To see hits like "Sweet Child O' Mine," "Paradise City," and "Welcome to the Jungle," fans shelled out as much as $280 per ticket.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-204578 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-142912292.jpg alt="Michael Loccisano/Getty Images" width=900 height=618 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-204578 class=wp-caption-text>Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Granted, not all that money goes directly to the band's members. There are obviously crew members to pay, but the production costs alone have been rumored to cost around half a million dollars per show. However, these numbers above account for ticket sales only; the amount of merchandise sold at each venue likely takes care of the production costs, and then some.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One band member who will not be getting any of that money is former guitarist and co-founder </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Izzy Stradlin</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. He elected not to participate in the reunion, tweeting that the band "didn't want to split the loot equally." While it's unconfirmed how much per show Guns N' Roses offered Stradlin, hopefully he's not regretting his decision after seeing these earnings.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.
