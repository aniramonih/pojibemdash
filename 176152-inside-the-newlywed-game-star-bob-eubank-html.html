He was such a bachelor,” James</p><p class="Fg Gg">in an interview with Westlake Malibu Lifestyle. “We both had just got out of committed, long relationships, and were not looking for anything serious.”</p><p class=Fg>At the time, Deborah was finishing her college degree, and she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.wmlifestyle.com/coverstory-march-2019/>asked</a> if she could interview him for her final paper. He agreed.</p><p class=Fg>They met at Jerry’s Deli in Studio City for what was supposed to be an hour, but they ended up having lunch and dinner together.</p><p class=Fg>“Something was bigger than us both, and 28 years later, he’s still making me laugh, just about different things now,” James <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.wmlifestyle.com/coverstory-march-2019/>said</a>.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Dealing with personal issues first</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Although James and Eubanks’ connection was instantaneous, they didn’t jump into marriage right away.

Adding that on her side, she had some emotional scars to heal from her childhood—she was adopted and later found her birth parents only to have her father committing suicide when she was still a kid.</p><p class=Fg>“My father may have been emotionally absent due to his alcohol addiction, but he loved me, and we always had a good and loving relationship. You can love someone, but sometimes you don’t respect them or their choices.”</p><p class=Fg>Trying to help each other, Eubanks and James committed to working in therapy as individuals and as a couple, so when it was time for them to get married, they had done most of the hard work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/542765f59e6a6cd43108ee90466303ca945441571165038.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Bob Eubanks attends The Midnight Mission's Golden Heart Awards Gala on November 9, 2017 | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=Fg>“We definitely cheered each other on, running wardrobe selections and even running lines back and forth for auditions,” she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.wmlifestyle.com/coverstory-march-2019/>recalled</a> of those days. “Even today, we want the best for each other and have each other’s backs.”</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Third time’s the charm</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Eubanks and James had to postpone their wedding on two occasions due to the unexpected deaths of their loved ones, Irma was probably one of them.</p><p class=Fg>At first, they had 200 guests on their list. For the second date, they reduced the list to 130, and when the time came for them to tie the knot, finally, they did it with only 30 of their closest family members and friends.</p><p class=Fg>“So, the 30 lucky people came to Palm Springs, where we spent three glorious days playing golf, spa-ing, and eating and drinking with our closest family and friends. Intimate but memorable, the perfect combination for us.”</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>The perfect combination of his parents</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>According to Deborah, Noah has the best of her and Bob, respectively.</p><p class=Fg>“He’s definitely an amazing combination of both my husband and myself from the deep voice to the crazy color-coding in his closet that he inherited from me,” she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.wmlifestyle.com/coverstory-march-2019/>explained</a>.
