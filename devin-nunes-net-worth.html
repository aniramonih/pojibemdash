He delivered the opening statement for the GOP minority during the public hearings, and perpetuated the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine that had tried to influence the 2016 presidential election instead of Russia. Later, Nunes worked with <a href=# title="Rudy Giuliani Net Worth">Rudy Giuliani</a>'s associate Lev Parnas to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate <a href=# title="Joe Biden Net Worth">Joe Biden</a>, which was exactly what Trump was currently facing impeachment for doing.</p><h2 id=defamation-lawsuits-against-others><strong>Defamation Lawsuits Against Others</strong></h2><p>Nunes has been notorious for filing multiple "SLAPP" <a href=#>defamation lawsuits that experts have described</a> as "virtually free of merit." He filed at least 11 of these between 2019 and 2023, including ones against Twitter, Elizabeth Mair, and the Twitter accounts @DevinNunesMom and @DevinCow.

Elsewhere, he has filed defamation lawsuits against the McClatchy Company, Ryan Lizza and Hearst Magazines, the Campaign for Accountability, Fusion GPS, CNN, and the Guardian. Most of these lawsuits have been dismissed or withdrawn.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2003, Nunes married elementary school teacher Elizabeth Tamariz.
