According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Glossyfied</a>, Cole works as a traffic control specialist. The outlet explained that this means he's "responsible for ensuring that roads and highways are in good condition at all times. The actual day-to-day work is pretty hands-on and may involve cutting brush that has grown along the roadside, removing obstacles on roads, placing snow way makers, and overseeing road maintenance workers." The role reportedly earns an average of $42K a year.</p><p>For the record, Cole's wife <a href=#>Chelsea Houska</a> isn't the only one getting her entrepreneur on. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>In Touch Weekly</a>, Cole launched his own sock line in 2017. And in 2019, he announced the Chelsea + Cole Collection with a company called Itzy Ritzy, writing on <a href=#>IG</a>, "We're beyond excited to announce that we're collaborating with @itzyritzy on a collection of cool products for everyone and parents just like us!!!" The collection includes diaper bags and blankets.</p><p>His Instagram bio also mentions an account he and Chelsea share called <a href=#>Down Home DeBoers</a>, which boasts about "bringing our farmhouse dreams to life."&nbsp;The page gives a look at the couple's&nbsp;<a href=#>home renovations</a>, as well as a link to a <a href=#>wallpaper line</a>. In other words, this&nbsp;Teen Mom 2&nbsp;pair knows how to capitalize on their strengths and&nbsp;the spotlight, and their fans seem very here for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3BobIVxe8Koo55llJqvsLHRZq6hmaRisKmxy6ycmmWYpMK0t8CsZKGto5eur7CMnaaeq12bvLN5wGajoq6Zo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veep-anna-chlumsky-welcomes-baby-number-two.html><span>←</span><span>Veep star Anna Chlumsky welcomes baby number two find out the name and gender!</span></a>
