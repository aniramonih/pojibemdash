The TV hostess is stepmother to <strong>Victoria Gifford Kennedy</strong>, the irate mother of the bride who first told the Boston Herald that Swift crashed her daughter's nuptials.</p><p>"Why can't I stay out of trouble? I was just a guest at that wedding. [Kyle] is actually my granddaughter by marriage ," Gifford began.</p><p>Victoria Gifford Kennedy explained to the Herald that cousin <strong>Conor Kennedy</strong> — Swift's beau of one-and-a-half months — texted her "an hour before the wedding," asking if they could attend. Although she asked them not to attend, the high-wattage pair "came anyway." When the mother of the bride confronted Swift and asked her to leave, she said, "It was like talking to a ghost. She seemed to look right past me."</p><p>Says Kathie Lee: "The truth is, because I was there, Vicki's account is accurate." She confirmed that the "Speak Now" singer and Conor, 18, were asked to leave "twice."</p><p>Although she spotted the crooner "in the hallway, waiting around," Kathie Lee explained, "I didn't know there was any drama going on at the time until I spoke to Vicki." Giving the Grammy winner the benefit of the doubt, she added, "I'm not sure [Taylor] didn't know she was invited."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Victoria Kennedy's concern wasn't just maintaining proper RSVP etiquette — but keeping the focus on the bride, not the global star in attendance.</p><p>"It's the bride's day, and that was Vicki's other concern. 'This is my daughter's day and I would appreciate it if you would not come.'"</p><p>Swift's rep countered to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> Wednesday: "Taylor was invited to the wedding and the bride thanked her profusely for being there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKarJiesm64xJ5koKGWm7yzsIyiZLChpKOytL%2FEnWStmamhvLN50rCgn6xdmL%2Biv8dmop6mnpqxunnWnpudoZ6cenN8kGtpbHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karen-tang-mvfu-html.html><span>←</span><span>Karen Tang (Doctor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
