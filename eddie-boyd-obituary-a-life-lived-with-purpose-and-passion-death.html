Eddie was more than just a member of our team; he was a true gentleman and a Troon unsung hero. In honor of his memory, we’ve invited his wife, Julie, and other family members to join us for an evening of reminiscence. To facilitate this gathering, we ask everyone to assemble pitchside at 7:15.</p><p>This timing ensures a smoother transition from the previous session, allowing the car park to clear by 7 PM. Due to limited on-site parking, consider arriving a bit early and be prepared to park a little further away. Whether you plan to play or not, your presence is valued. We encourage all to share their thoughts and memories of Eddie, celebrating the impact he had on our lives and the Troon community.</p><p>In addition to honoring Eddie’s memory, there’s an opportunity to contribute to our GoFundMe page for McMillans. If you can spare some extra cash, please bring it along. Every contribution is appreciated as we support a cause that holds significance to our community. As we gather, be prepared for our renowned Cornish elements. Let the familiar cries of ‘keep them in’ and ‘six seconds ref’ resound on the pitch once more.</p><p>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwscOdoJ5lkqTGpXnOm6CtrZGnxm6tjKWgn51doba3scNmrqKsmGK9tr7PqKqeZZGjsW68wKyqoqeeYrGmrdOhZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vice-president-kamala-harris-take-over-president-biden.html><span>←</span><span>Democrats have a bigger problem if Kamala Harris takes over as President</span></a>
