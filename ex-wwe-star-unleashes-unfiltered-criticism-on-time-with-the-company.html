He eventually parted ways with WWE back in 2020 and has never looked back since. That said, EC3 admitted that his stint in WWE was very bad.</p><p>After an underwhelming initial run in WWE&nbsp;from 2009-2013, EC3 signed with WWE as a top star back in 2018 after a terrific stint in Impact Wrestling. However, while his NXT run was solid, his main roster run spelt doom for his career.</p><p>After his departure, EC3 made his return to Impact Wrestling where he had a brief stint. After that, he competed in other promotions, including ROH and eventually founded his Control Your Narrative promotion. However, that endeavour did not prove to be a successful one.</p><p>While speaking in a new interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Bleeding Cool</a>, EC3 talked about Exodus Pro and would go on to describe his time in WWE, making it clear he had nothing good to say about his time there.</p><p>“NWA Exodus Pro is a passion project, and we are fortunate enough to be one of the first territorial affiliates of the NWA in the new era. It came from controlling your narrative. It came knowing what I wanted, not necessarily a promotion, but I wanted that to be a platform for talent to be discovered or reinvent themselves. That was my creative outlet during the pandemic, and I’m getting fired. It was kind of like therapy in my very, very real life. You know, the WWE run was dogshit. It sucked dirty hairy balls, let’s be honest. But I said to myself, ‘I’m a better speaker than almost everybody on this roster, and I never had a chance to speak.’ So, the idea stemmed from that with CYN.”</p><p>“I will put a better promo out every week than anybody’s doing regarding context and creativity. Maybe not production value or eyes seeing it, but creatively, I will put out something better than you see on Monday or Friday night. So, the real germ of it all was CYN. What it really meant was to tell your story. I could tell mine, and I wanted to create something that allowed others to tell theirs. So, after I made the necessary adjustments and cut the necessary people out of my life. I repackaged that as Exodus.”</p><p>EC3 is currently focused on his own ventures in promotions such as the NWA and he wouldn’t want it any other way. That said, it remains to be seen whether he will ever return to WWE, as that seems unlikely right now.</p><p>What’s your view on what EC3 said about his run in WWE?
