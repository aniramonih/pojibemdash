Wikipedia Bio &amp;amp; Age Details Of The Horse Trainer The Talks Today</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Michael Barisone was a reserve at the 2008 Olympics. He used to be an Olympian. He is a horse trainer who was found guilty of trying to kill one of his students in a New Jersey courtroom.</strong></p><p>The Olympic athlete is in the news right now, but not for a good reason. Michael Barisone, who is 58 years old, was put on trial earlier this year because his student, Lauren Kanarek, said he tried to kill her.</p><p>His lawyers said that Barisone was crazy at the time of the shooting and shouldn’t be held legally responsible for what he did. But insanity as a defense is rare and rarely works. Barisone’s argument is that Lauren Kanarek’s use of social media pushed him over the edge.</p><p>Kanarek, who used Facebook a lot, started to post her dramatic complaints. And they got worse over the course of the 2019 summer. On July 25, 2019, Kanarek wrote. In another post, she says that Barisone is “racist and anti-Semitic.” He says that this is not true.</p><figure id=attachment_60734 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-60734 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Michael Barisone</figure><h2>What’s Michael Barisone’s name? The horse trainer’s Wikipedia page</h2><p>Wikipedia says that Michael Barisone used to train horses for the Olympics. Barisone was a master at training horses to dance, which is called “dressage.”</p><p>He was thought to be one of the best teachers in the world. While he was on Team USA in Beijing, he taught Boyd Martin and Allison Brock, both of whom went on to win Olympic medals.</p><p>Barisone has done a lot of great things, like being on the dressage team for the 2008 Olympics.

But after what happened with Lauren, Barisone sold both of them. Barisone spent two years in jail before his trial started.</p><p>A judge decided that Barisone should get mental health treatment at the less restrictive Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital starting September 7, 2022, with a follow-up hearing in six months to see how he is doing. On the other hand, Lauren is getting back to horseback riding after years of surgeries and treatments.</p><h2>Find out how old Michael Barisone is</h2><p>Michael Barisone has been alive for 58 years.

Vera Kessels-Barisone is either his wife or the woman he used to be married to.</p><p>Vera was born in the Netherlands, and in the 1980s and 1990s, she was a professional jumper and dressage rider. Since she moved to the United States in 1995, she has put all of her time and energy into dressage, and she has done very well.</p><p>She used to be a partner at Barisone Dressage, where she specialized in bringing up young horses through the ranks. As a result, she has trained several Grand Prix horses and riders.</p><p>Some of the horses have run in the World Cup, the Olympics, and the Pan American Games. Vera is a teacher who spends the summer in Connecticut and the winter in Florida.</p><h2>How much money does Michael Barisone have?</h2><p>During his best years, Michael Barisone had a lot of money. It’s hard to say how much Michael is worth, but he has two horse farms where he trains the horses himself.</p><p>Before the accusations, Michael’s main way of making money was by training horses. Michael’s horse classes are the best for many people because he is so good at what he does.</p><p>In March 2018, Kanarek started training with the former Olympian. Kanarek wanted to be a horse rider, and it didn’t take long for her to spend $5,000 a month to train, board, and live in a farmhouse on Barisone’s property.</p><p>Barisone also made money from tournaments like the Olympics early in his career. He was a well-known name.</p><p>Michael Barisone was tried for trying to kill someone, but he was found not guilty because he was crazy.</p><p>On August 7, 2019, he fired two shots at award-winning equestrian Lauren Kanarek, leaving her hanging on to life.

He was also charged with having guns he wasn’t supposed to have.</p><p>In August 2019, he shot Lauren at his Hawthorne Hill farm in Long Valley. He shot her twice in the chest while missing her fiance with a shot meant for him.</p><p>The shootings were done with a pink and black Ruger 9mm handgun. Lauren and Barisone are said to have had a fight over a landlord-tenant issue.</p><p>Barisone’s lawyer said that Lauren had fought a mental war against Barisone, which made him snap and shoot Lauren.</p><h2>Michael Barisone’s Family and Wife</h2><p>Michael Barisone hasn’t told everyone everything they need to know about his wife and family just yet. We haven’t found out all the details about his family yet, so we can’t update this section.</p><p>The Barisone family is happy that Mr. Barisone was found not guilty and can go home.</p><p>The series of articles called “Featured Clinician” is made possible by a partnership between STRIDERTM and the USEA. This article was first posted on useventing.com and is being posted again here to make sure it gets the most exposure possible. All of the content is protected by copy rights, so it can’t be copied without written permission.</p><p>Michael Barisone, an Olympic dressage rider, is probably best known outside of the horse world as “the man who taught Stephen Colbert to “piaffe it” on TV.</p><p>Dressage fans call him one of “The Big Guys.” He is one of the very few riders who have been to the Olympics both as a member of the team and as a coach.</p><p>Eventers often know him as the man who has worked with Phillip Dutton, Boyd Martin, and Clark Montgomery, all of whom were on the Olympic team, as well as many other top riders in the sport.</p><p>Our team at STRIDER was able to talk to him during a rare free moment over lunch at a clinic at Sprieser Sporthorse in Marshall, Virginia. He lives in Long Valley, New Jersey, and Loxahatchee, Florida.</p><p>Barisone is always on the move, so it’s not easy to keep up with him. When he’s not coaching his students at national and international competitions, he often drives or flies to teach clinics. He will often move from sitting in a chair to standing in the middle of a room several times while teaching to make his points clearer.</p><p>Barisone is known for being funny and charismatic when he teaches. He often tries to make dressage both fun and easy to learn. We asked him what kind of rider he likes to teach and what he expects from riders who come to his clinics.</p><p>Since Barisone has had such a long and successful career, with more than 100 CDI Grand Prix wins and a World Cup Gold Medal (Hickstead, 1997), you might think that he wouldn’t want to teach riders who aren’t ready to get 80% at Grand Prix. Luckily, that’s not the case at all in our community.</p><p>He doesn’t expect riders and clinic attendees to be ready to do every move from the Grand Prix. Instead, he wants them to be ready “to listen and try new ideas.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you’re riding a green horse that won’t listen to you or if you’re practicing your two-tempi changes before the regional finals,” he said. “If you want to get better at riding, you have to be interested in learning the basics. The key to success is to fully understand the basics.”</p><p>“At the end of the day, it makes me happy if someone has a problem and I can help them solve it and succeed,” said Barisone.</p><p>As riders, we all want to find and use that one magic key to training horses that will get us to success and fame quickly. But Barisone says, “There are no miraculous victories that happen right away.”</p><p>Barisone admits that being careful with the basics of horse training can take a lot of time and not seem very exciting. “It might be boring at times, but it will get you further than any other method,” he says.</p><p>Michael Barisone is giving a clinic at Sprieser Sporthorse. The image is owned by Liz Bloom and can’t be used without her written permission.</p><p>Barisone’s teaching and riding are filled with clear echoes of this mantra. He tells riders over and over again that “giving up doesn’t work” and that “determination will get you farther than anything else.”</p><p>We asked Barisone if his younger, more determined self could have learned anything from the wisdom he has gained through years of hard work.</p><p>“Everyone needs a basic set of skills. No matter how smart or talented your horse is, it doesn’t matter. He still needs the most basic things,” he said. “Even if you have a very special horse, don’t treat him any differently than any other horse. He still has to be normal.”</p><p>He then went on to talk about one of his favorite ways to teach. “Teaching horses is a lot like bringing up kids. No matter how far they go in life, all kids in the eighth grade have to act the same. Don’t make exceptions for bad behavior or give the horse short cuts just because it’s smart.”</p><p>Want to see Michael Barisone do his thing?
