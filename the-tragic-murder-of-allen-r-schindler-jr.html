Schindler Jr.'s shipmates weren't the only ones that picked on him. According to <a href=#>Esquire</a>, when Belleau Wood was pulling out to go to <a href=#>Hawaii</a>, many sailors didn't get back from shore leave in time, including Schindler. However, Schindler was the only one written up for his absence.</p><p dir=ltr>Increasingly frustrated at the harassment, Schindler tried to let his "true colors" out, according to "<a href=#>Unfinished Lives</a>." While on radio duty in September 1992, Schindler transmitted the message "2-Q-T-2-B-S-T-R-8" ("Too cute to be straight"), which reached most of the Pacific Fleet. Schindler was immediately charged with broadcasting an "unauthorized statement." Schindler requested a meeting with Captain Douglas J. Bradt, his commanding officer, and Captain Bernard Meyer, the ship's legal officer. At this meeting, Schindler came out as a gay man and was told that he would be discharged, though the administrative discharge proceedings would take a few weeks. Later, <a href=#>Schindler</a> would write of the meeting in his journal, noting, "If you can't be yourself, then who are you?"</p><p dir=ltr>On September 25, Schindler's non-judicial proceeding regarding his unauthorized message was held. But while Captain Bradt could've held a closed proceeding, he held an open proceeding that ended up having over 200 sailors in attendance. At one point during the proceedings, Schindler covered the microphone with his hand and whispered to Bradt, "You know what I am." For the unauthorized broadcast, Schindler was sentenced to 30 days restriction to the ship and had his rank demoted from RM1 to RM3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCk2trbWhfqbWmedOrmKChk2K6tr7Dnqlmp5Zirq24xKdkq2WjmLWqusOlnKtlmqd8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-reason-drew-barrymore-and-tom-green-split.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Reason Drew Barrymore And Tom Green Split</span></a>
