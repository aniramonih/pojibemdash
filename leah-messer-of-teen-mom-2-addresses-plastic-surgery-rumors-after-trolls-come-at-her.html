Dang! Darn you!”</p><p>“Let me just say, first and foremost, I will never, ever, knock what another woman chooses to do with her body at any given time. But, plastic surgery has just never been for me. I’m scared!” she continued.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“I’m scared of, I’m terrified of any kind of surgery.

After <a href=#>debuting a dramatic makeover</a> with dark brown hair, trolls attacked Chelsea’s look and said she still <a href=#>needs a makeover</a>.</p><p>Trolls didn’t stop there, though — some thought that Chelsea overdoes her self-tanner, <a href=#>calling it too orange</a>, and accused her of <a href=#>overdoing her lip fillers</a>. Chelsea didn’t deny getting fillers, but did deny that her dad, <a href=#>Randy Houska, administered them</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Another current Teen Mom 2 cast member, Briana DeJesus, came under fire for the <a href=#>results of her Brazilian butt lift</a>, when trolls said it looked like she had a “diaper butt.”</p><p>Ashley Jones, the newest cast member on Teen Mom 2, recounted a <a href=#>scary cosmetic procedure</a> of her own that landed her in the hospital. Ashley also <a href=#>defended the other moms’</a> choices to have elective cosmetic procedures done.</p><p>Jade Cline’s plastic surgery journey has been a major storyline this season on Teen Mom 2. Although her recovery didn’t go as planned, she seems to be <a href=#>happy with her decision</a> to go under the knife.</p><p>When she’s not addressing rumors that she’s had plastic surgery, Leah is working on <a href=#>obtaining her real estate license</a> and recently <a href=#>hinted at a project</a> with castmate and BFF Kail Lowry.</p><p>Teen Mom 2 airs on Tuesdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5yarql5zJ6qrJ2iYrynedOenKdlnaS6bn6MmpudqpWowKa%2FjKmjmquknrBuv9Srnp6qqWK%2FtrnOq6pmmZapsrN506umpaSjYrCwucRmmK1lmJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-cosmetics-x-stormi-valentines-day-collection-is-coming-details.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Cosmetics x Stormi Valentines Day Collection Is Coming: Details</span></a>
