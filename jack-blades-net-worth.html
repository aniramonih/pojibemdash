His career started in the late 1970s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jack Blades is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources it has been estimated that Blades’ net worth is as high as $20 million, an amount earned through his successful career in the music industry.</p><h3>Jack Blades Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Jack was introduced to the guitar when he was eight years old. His parents initially bought him a plastic ukulele, and from then he started a journey to become one of the most successful bass guitarists of the rock scene. He went to Arcadia High School, but moved to Indio High School in his second year and matriculated in 1972. He then enrolled at the College of the Desert in Palm Desert, where he met and befriended Pat Rizzo, who played saxophone for Sly and the Family Stone. The two started rehearsing together and Pat introduced him to Jerry Martini. However, Jack then enrolled at San Diego State University and for the next couple of years wasn’t involved in the music scene.</p><p>Nevertheless, in 1975 he took leave of absence from college and moved to San Francisco where he rejoined Jerry, and together with Brad Gillis formed the band Rubicon. However, the band was short lived, with two studio albums “Rubicon” (1978) and “America Dreams” (1979), and one hit single “I’m Gonna Take Care of Everything”. After Rubicon ceased to exist, Jack took Gillis and Kelly Keagy to form Stereo, which would then become Night Ranger with a change in line-up. Their first album came out in 1982, entitled “Dawn Patrol” reaching No. 38 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Two albums that followed – “Midnight Madness” (1983), and “7 Wishes” (1985) – achieved platinum status, which only increased Jack’s net worth. From then their popularity began to decline, and in 1989 Jack left the group and started another project, which would become Damn Yankees, featuring <a href=#>Ted Nugent</a>, <a href=#>Tommy Shaw</a>, and Michael Cartellone. They released two albums before disbandment, “Damn Yankees” in 1990, which achieved double platinum status and “Don’t Tread” (1992), which achieved gold status, further increasing Jack’s net worth.</p><p>Then in 1996 he reformed Night Ranger, and since then the group has released six albums, including “Neverland” (1997), “Hole in the Sun” (2007), “High Road” (2014), and most recently “Don’t Let Up” (2017). In addition to albums, they often tour in support of their new releases.</p><p>Jack has also released two solo albums “Jack Blades” (2004), and “Rock n’ Roll Ride” (2012), the sales of which also added to his wealth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Jack has been married to Mollie since 1977; the couple has two children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.413793103448><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jack Blades</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 24, 1954</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Palm Desert, California, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Bassist, Songwriter, Musician, Singer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>San Diego State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Mollie Blades (m. 1977)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Colin Blades</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jack Martin Blades , Blades, Jack</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/JackBlades/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/jackblades</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1061987/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jack-blades-mn0000123104</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Music Groups</td><td>Night Ranger, Damn Yankees (1989 – 2010), Revolution Saints, Tak Matsumoto Group</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Damn Yankees</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>100 Greatest Songs of the '80s</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Musician.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Has two sons, Colin and James</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=28.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=18><td>Night Ranger: 24 Strings and a Drummer</td><td>2012</td><td>Video documentary writer: "This Boy Needs to Rock", "When You Close Your Eyes", "Sing Me Away", "Growin' Up In California", "The Secret of My Success", "Sentimental Street", "Four in the Morning", "Let Him Run", "Goodbye", "Forever All Over Again", "Don't Tell Me You Love Me", "You Can Still Rock In America" -
