The single mom of four confessed in the season premiere that after she was married for four years, she got into an "entanglement" with someone, which resulted in a divorce. She revealed that following the split, she and her ex remarried but were in the process of another divorce.</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, during her conversation with Heather Gay, Garcia revealed that her "entanglement" was with her husband's sister's husband. In the shocking episode, she told Gay that she confessed to the church after feeling guilty and was thereby "shunned from everyone." She did note that her brother-in-law was not excommunicated. "They never excommunicate the men," the author of "Bad Mormon" stated. Despite the scandalous ending of her marriage, Garcia revealed that there was no ill will between her and her ex, and she gave an update on their relationship status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjZYVzgY6rn6irnJh6orLFmqCrZZWjsaawjKamp6GTlnqordGcoJplnZa%2Fs7XAoJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-rise-and-fall-of-chinese-billionaire-ye-jianming-who-built-a-44-billion-house-of-cards.html><span>←</span><span>The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Billionaire Ye Jianming, Who Built A $44 Billion House Of Cards</span></a>
