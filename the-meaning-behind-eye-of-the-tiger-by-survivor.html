It’s also super-inspiring and has to be one of the&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>best workout songs ever</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. But what about the meaning behind&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Eye of the Tiger”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;by Survivor? Let’s take a deeper look at this song to find out what it’s all about.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Survivor></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who is Survivor?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Meaning-Behind-Eye-of-the-Tiger-by-Survivor.png alt="The Meaning Behind “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor " width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before we jump into the song, it’s a good idea to get an understanding of the band that wrote it. Survivor is a band that was started back in 1978 by Jim Peternik (Ides of March, Chase, Jim Peternik Band) and Frankie Sullivan (Mariah), two musicians from Illinois.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They met and hit it off. So, they quickly recruited Dave Bickler (Jamestown Massacre) as a lead singer, and Dennis Johnson and Gary Smith from Chase on the bass and drums, respectively.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The band would change their line-up frequently. Dismissing members who couldn’t keep up with their intense recording and touring schedule or those whose styles didn’t match well with the band. The list of past members is about as long as your arm.</span></p><p><strong>A lead singer is a pretty important part of any band…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, it’s strange that Survivor repeatedly flipped back and forth between two singers – Dave Bickler and Jimi Jamison – over the years. They also had Robin McAuley for a while, and their current singer is Cameron Barton.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite being in the game since their first album,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Survivor</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, in 1979, this band has only released eight studio albums. Their latest,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Reach</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, came out in 2006. Instead, the band has focused more on intensive touring both in the US and around the globe.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This Rock band has won a Grammy Award, sold a double platinum record, and played thousands of concerts globally.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_History_of_%E2%80%9CEye_of_the_Tiger%E2%80%9D></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The History of&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></a><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you want to know the meaning behind&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Eye of the Tiger”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;by Survivor, there are a few references to look at. The first is in the band’s name itself.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jim Peternik was a member of the band Ides of March, which had a hit with their song&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Vehicle”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;back in 1970. However, this band fell apart, and many of the members didn’t continue in the music business. But Peternik did and was called a survivor by his contemporaries.</span></p><p><strong>This idea stuck and became a major part of his identity…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And, of course, the name of his new project. Aside from the name Survivor, the term is also a focus of the&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>lyrics for&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Furthermore, the original name for this song was “Survival,” but that was changed at the last minute.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The words “survive” and “survivor” are still in the lyrics, however, and this is one&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>major theme of&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. The other main thing to remember is how this song was created in the first place.</span></p><p><strong>Survivor had put out two albums by 1981…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The second album,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Premonition</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;(a very apt title though they didn’t know it at the time), included the minor hit&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Poor Man’s Son”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. This song had a strong beat, punchy guitar chords, and a driving bassline, and showed off Bickler’s strong voice at the time.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was a great premonition of things to come. The song had a slight Disco feel and a Rock edge that caught the attention of none other than Sylvester Stallone.</span></p><p><strong>Sly had already found huge success with his first two Rocky movies…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, he was looking to continue the franchise with<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Rocky III</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. If you don’t remember, that’s the one where he battles James Lang (Mr. T) for the heavyweight title, with the help of his once rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Stallone wanted to use Queen’s&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Another One Bites the Dust”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;but that deal didn’t work out.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Instead, he contacted Survivor and asked them to produce a theme song for his upcoming film. Furthermore, he sent them the first 10 minutes to inspire them to write a song. Survivor sent him a couple of songs to consider, but the one that he chose – thank goodness he did! – was&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Eye of the Tiger”</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>It was the perfect fit for his film…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The movie is about Rocky finding out that his manager, Mickey, hand-picked easy fights for him to let him keep his championship. James Lang challenges him and also assaults Mickey, which leads to his death.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>SPOILER ALERT (for a 40-year-old movie!?) – Lang beats him to a pulp and wins the championship. However, Apollo Creed offers to help Rocky train and become the fighter he once was, and he takes back his belt. So, this film is very much about being down and out but coming back to win – being a survivor.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_of_%E2%80%9CEye_of_the_Tiger%E2%80%9D></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Meaning of&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></a><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With the&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>main inspiration for&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;understood, it’s easy to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>interpret the lyrics of&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><strong>This song is about both endurance and redemption…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It refers to being down and out and then coming back to succeed. But, of course, it’s not specifically about boxing, and this message can be applied to anything in life.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It’s also about being hard, vicious, and even ferocious in your quest for success. This is&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>the meaning of the&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. The song says that to succeed, you need to have the singular focus and determination of a tiger.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But not just on a normal hunt. This is a tiger fighting against the threat of a rival for control of its territory and, ultimately, its entire life. It’s a very strong image, and it’s the reason why the line “the eye of the tiger” has stuck so well in the collective consciousness.</span></p><p><strong>This&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>song is all about fighting</a>&nbsp;to get and keep what’s yours…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It’s about pushing yourself relentlessly to succeed, and it’s about never giving up. That made it the perfect song for&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rocky III</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. As well as an incredible inspiration for anyone with a big goal in mind, whether that is career success, fitness, or just trying to hold a very complicated life together.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Music_Behind_%E2%80%9CEye_of_the_Tiger%E2%80%9D></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Music Behind&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></a><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Yes, the lyrics for this song are big and bold. But they wouldn’t mean half what they do without the inspiring music to back them up and fill them with passion. Luckily, Survivor nailed it with this song.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their past work and the state of music at the time greatly influenced this song. At the end of the 70s and into the 80s, Disco was slowly disappearing from the spotlight and dissolving into the bigger ocean of Rock Music. But you can still hear a little Disco influence here, especially in the dancey drum beat and the thudding bassline.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This song starts with one of the most dramatic intros in music history. The first thing you hear is a staccato, muted, distorted guitar that almost reminds you of a machine gun. Then, huge guitar chords and cymbal crashes (Duh! Duh-duh-duh!) come in and make this intro epic.</span></p><p><strong>In the verses…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The guitar and bass continue while Peternik’s keyboard part fills out the sound and creates drama. Then there’s the chorus with such a great hook that it’s impossible not to sing along to. The guitar hits big chords and follows the soaring vocals through to the end of the chorus, giving it great energy.</span></p><p><strong>And speaking of energy…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dave Bickler sings this song perfectly. He keeps the verses bright and strong but adds more energy in the chorus, where his voice soars up and very nearly roars like a tiger.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The beat and staccato guitar have the pulse of someone practically marching down the street with a single-minded stride. And the big guitar chords hit like boxing gloves raining down on an opponent.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, the music was a perfect illustration of the action in the&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Rocky III</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;film, making it one of the most memorable moments in movie-music history.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legacy_of_%E2%80%9CEye_of_the_Tiger%E2%80%9D></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Legacy of&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Eye of the Tiger”</span></a><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Survivor has eight albums under their belt and 40 years as a band. They wrote and recorded other theme songs, like&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“The Moment of Truth”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>&nbsp;</strong>for 1984’s&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>The Karate Kid</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Burning Heart”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;for&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Rocky IV</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in 1985. But, they simply never again achieved the success that&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Eye of the Tiger”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;brought them.</span></p><p><strong>This song was an unadulterated success…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The original demo version was used in the film&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rocky III</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Afterward, a professional studio version was recorded for Survivor’s album,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eye of the Tiger</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This track got tons of airplay and video play, enough that it shot up to #1 in the charts and stayed there for six weeks. The record has been certified double platinum, having sold over two million physical units and over four million downloads worldwide.</span></p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>“Eye of the Tiger”</strong></span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;won the Grammy for Best Rock Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal in 1983, cementing Survivor’s musical legacy.
