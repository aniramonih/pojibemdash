Life is all about perspective, and my perspective is clear! That @ayeshacurry….that’s my baby right there….love you and thank you for being my Proverbs 31:10-11 everyday!”</p><p>Stephen made headlines in December 2019 when his alleged nude photos surfaced on Twitter. His agent said the images were “absolutely” not real, while Ayesha later joked about cooking “eggplant parmesan” on Instagram Live in an apparent reference to the scandal. “Perfect, right?” she said with a laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWltaa6jJysq6qpYsCprdGeqmaqmai%2BtrGMqZ%2BorJ9ixKrAx2aYsp2jna5ur9SrqbJln6N6t63Cmquip55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhoa-sheree-whitfield-new-man-martell-holt-cheating-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Sheree Whitfield's New Man Martell Holt Has A Cheating Scandal In His Past</span></a>
