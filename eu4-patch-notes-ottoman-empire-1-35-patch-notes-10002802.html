But before we get to that, I want to comment on some lessons we have learned from the development process of Lions of the North, even if we are quite happy with the final result and its release state:</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p><span><ul><li>Branching missions are like seasoning: a few of them can add some interesting paths to your country. Too much and they ruin the mission tree as they are clunky to use, generate walls of text and are in general not pretty to look at.<br>They are also prone to script-related bugs and are too painful to maintain. Because of that, we will not have any case akin to the Teutonic Order in the future where half of the mission tree is covered in branching missions.</li><li>Customizable government reforms like the ones of Livonia were a fun experiment, but from a script perspective a nightmare to create. It also requires the player to have Wikipedia open in order to get the government reform they desire, which is not optimal.<br>We liked the idea that you can customize your government reform in such a fashion, but for the future, we will instead utilize the different government tiers instead of having 15 different Tier 1 reforms for a single country.</li><li>The new generic government reforms and tiers were exceptionally well received. Even though some reforms are still standing out as the most optimal choice, we like the diversity we see from the player base in their choice of government reforms.<br>For 1.35, we want to expand this aspect of the game a bit further.</li><li>Too many “starting points” of the mission tree can be quite overwhelming for the player - especially if they are far down. While this is inevitable to happen due to the rigid structure of mission trees (and a whole new redesign of how mission trees are built would be like opening Pandora’s Box), we try to at least keep the amount of starting points to a minimum.</li><li>The focus of previous Immersion Packs was too much on mission trees alone. While mission trees are highly popular, we think that we were investing too much time and focus on the mission tree part of a country and neglecting other parts of the gameplay experience. In 1.35, we still make sure to have interesting mission trees for the countries in focus which encourage unique playstyles, but we will also diversify from this part of the content and expand other parts of the country such as tag unique government reforms, flavor events, and even mechanics.</li><li>Finally, mission trees and the content from Lions of the North make the content outside of the region of focus feel very outdated - even if the region’s specific update was not that long ago. The new DLC and the 1.35 update aim to change this and we try to go beyond our scope to expand the countries and regions which are not the focus of the former DLC.</li></ul></span></p><p>With that being said, let us dive into the content for one of the most anticipated countries in EU4: the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>No country in EU4 splits the community like the Ottomans. Some say they are too easy to beat and don’t have this “final boss feeling” they desire from the game. Others claim that the Ottomans are absurdly overpowered and ruining the fun of the game.</p><p>But everyone can agree on one thing about them: despite its number of flavor events, unique mechanics and even unique special units, the Ottomans feel rather bland compared to all the other major powers of EU4, as it’s been a while since the last update on their content. 1.35 will change this.</p><p>You can view the complete patch notes below,</p><p><a href=#>Europa Universalis IV Patch</a></p><h2><span>Europa Universalis IV Game Info</span></h2><p><span>The 2013 grand strategy video game Europa Universalis IV, a follow-up to Europa Universalis III, was created by Paradox Development Studio and released by Paradox Interactive. The game was made available on August 13, 2013. Players can take control of a country from the Late Middle Ages to the Early Modern Period (1444–1821) in this strategy game by managing trade, government, diplomacy, colonization, and military.</span></p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p><span>Following the release of Divine Wind, the last DLC for Europa Universalis III, in December 2010, early concept discussions for Europa Universalis IV were held, with development, based on the Clausewitz Engine, starting in earnest in or around September 2011. After being hinted under the codename "Project Truman," it was initially made public in August 2012 to coincide with a showing at that year's Gamescom.</span></p><h2><span>Europa Universalis IV Gameplay</span></h2><p><span>The game has been designed to start historically, with events taking place at the appropriate times in history. The actual game is an interactive map of the world divided into the nations' constituent provinces. Provinces can both act as a source of resources for a country and a source of instability and rebellion, therefore each of these provinces makes contributions to their country that are either positive or harmful. In order to succeed in the game, the player must strike a balance between the military, diplomacy, and economy. The player does this by exercising their sovereign authority over their country and by making decisions regarding how to best use the resources at their disposal, including prestige, power projection, stability, gold (ducats), manpower, legitimacy for monarchies, republican tradition for republics, devotion for theocracies, horde unity for steppe nomads, meritocracy for celestial empires, and monarch power (administrative, diplomatic, and military).</span></p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p><span></span></p><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>EU4 Patch Notes - FAQs</h2>1.
