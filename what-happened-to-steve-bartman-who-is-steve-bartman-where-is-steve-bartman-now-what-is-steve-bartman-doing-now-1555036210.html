This incident took place during Major League Baseball's 2003 postseason, specifically Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS).</p><p>At that point in the game, the Cubs were leading 3-0 in the eighth inning and had a three-games-to-two advantage in the best-of-seven series. The Marlins' batter, Luis Castillo, hit a fly ball into foul territory in the left field. Moisés Alou, the Cubs' outfielder, made a leaping attempt to catch the ball near the wall. It was during this crucial moment that Steve Bartman, a Cubs fan seated in the front row along the left field corner wall, also went for the ball.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bartman deflected the ball away from Alou's glove, preventing what could have been the second out of the inning. The umpire, Mike Everitt, determined that the play was not fan interference. If Alou had made the catch, it would have brought the Cubs closer to securing their first National League pennant since 1945, as they were just four outs away from victory. However, the ruling allowed the Marlins to extend their offensive opportunity.</p><p>Bartman's actions became the center of attention as Alou expressed his frustration by slamming his glove and shouting at some fans, including Bartman. The Cubs, particularly Alou and their pitcher Mark Prior, argued for fan interference, but the ruling stood. It is worth noting that Cubs manager Dusty Baker did not witness the incident due to the obstructed view from the dugout.</p><p>Throughout the years, Everitt's decision has faced extensive scrutiny. Various sources, such as the authors of "Mad Ball: The Bartman Play," have analyzed photographs and claimed that Bartman's arms extended into the playing field, suggesting that Castillo should have been called out due to fan interference. The incident received significant media coverage, including Fox commentator Thom Brennaman's exclamation, "Again in the air, down the left field line. Alou...reaching into the stands...and couldn't get it, and he's livid with a fan!" This incident marked a pivotal moment in baseball history and has remained a topic of discussion and analysis among fans, experts, and sports enthusiasts.</p><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>What Happened to Steve Bartman - FAQs</h2>1.
