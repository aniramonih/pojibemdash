I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again,” the Brazil native — who shares son Benjamin, 12, and daughter Vivian, 9, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback — told Elle in their October 2022 cover story. (She is also stepmom of Brady’s son Jack, 15, whom he shares with ex <a href=#><strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong></a>.)</p><p>“But ultimately,” Bündchen, who has not been to any of Brady’s games this season, told the outlet, “I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.”</p><p>Brady, for his part, has faced many obstacles of his own​​ on the field as of late.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In August, the star player took <a href=#>a leave of absence</a> from the Buccaneers, head coach <strong>Todd Bowles</strong> revealed during a press conference at the time. “He’s going to deal with some personal things,” Bowles shared, adding that there is “something he needs to handle.”</p><p>One month later, <a href=#>Brady’s temper got the better of him</a> during a game between the Bucs and the New Orleans Saints and was caught on camera throwing his tablet to the ground while standing on the sidelines.</p><p>“Sorry for breaking that tablet,” the athlete later wrote via Twitter, joking, “I think that’s going to be another Twitter meme or something like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51ir7Otw7JkoKGjmrmmecGupZ2bmJq7brTIq5xmnJmrvLOvxGajmq%2Bpmr%2B0ecOeq5qhnKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tichina-arnold-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Tichina Arnold Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
