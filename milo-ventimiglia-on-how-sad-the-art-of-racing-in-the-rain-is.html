Remember when This Is Us kind of was knock-you-off-your-seat and you <a href=#>have to really hydrate,</a> because you knew you were gonna cry?” the Emmy nominee says. But, while you may need to drink a bottle of water after the film, that doesn’t mean all the tears will be sad ones.</p><p>“What I loved about Art of Racing was that it had a feeling of hope. It had this magical quality to it, where, there are things that <a href=#>happen in life</a> but it doesn’t bring us down, it actually lifts it up,” the Gilmore Girls alum adds. “That’s what I loved about the message of the movie that was carried over from the book. It was hopeful.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Milo-Ventimiglia-The-Art-of-Racing-in-The-Rain.jpg.jpg><p>For more from Ventimiglia, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly.</p><p>The Art of Racing in the Rain is in theaters Friday, August 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSipJ9iw6a606Kkop%2Bcnq5uu81mn6ivXaiupXnToZxmmaKperCyjKuYnKGenHqquoytn55lopa2r3nIrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-connelly-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Connelly Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
