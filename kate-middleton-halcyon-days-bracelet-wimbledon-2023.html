Kate wore an <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>aquamarine and gold bangle</a> from British heritage brand Halcyon Days, which comes in at a cool £150. “Our Salamander Torque bangle is crafted from 18 carat gold plated brass and can be squeezed for the perfect fit,” the label explains on its official website, “This sleek accessory is fitted with soothing aquamarine coloured cabochons at either end, and lends itself beautifully both to stacking with other styles or wearing solo.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/703163ac82d2-kate-middleton-wimbledon.jpg><p id=eJS_ov3DAu0j data-wc=65>Kate adorned the summer ensemble with her Wimbledon bow, while her long brunette hair was pinned in graceful half-up half-down style. Prior to the start of the match, Kate arrived an hour early and had the opportunity to meet with young ball boys and girls. As the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Kate is a devoted fan of the sport.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>What is Halcyon Days?</h2><p id=eRfUMugpe2Hi data-wc=46>Halcyon Days was established in 1950 with the purpose of showcasing antique gifts. During the late 18th century, enamelling on copper was a thriving art form. However, by the 1830s, it had nearly disappeared, with the technique being limited to functional items like saucepans by 1950.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/a11f2b0f4318-gettyimages-1545803620.jpg><p id=e56Mew1-v3Vr data-wc=111>Halcyon Days took on the task of revitalising this traditional craft and, by 1970, had established its own production facility. As the company expanded, its product range also grew. Today, in addition to their signature enamel boxes, they offer a wide selection of English fine bone china and premium accessories. Although their products are now sold worldwide, they are still handcrafted in two workshops located in the West Midlands, which have since become the thriving hubs of British pottery and enamelling industries. The brand is one of only fourteen companies in the world to hold all three Royal Warrants and is the only supplier of Objets d’Art to the royal family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5NybnFrY2S4osDEZqSinJShsrW7zWafmqSTrryvecOasKxlkqeupLHLnqtmr5mir62xw6ilZmpgZ4Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./watch-pictures-and-cctv-video-footage-of-people-who-shot-kiernan-forbes-aka-to-death-go-viral.html><span>←</span><span>Pictures and CCTV video footage of people who shot Kiernan Forbes AKA to death go viral</span></a>
