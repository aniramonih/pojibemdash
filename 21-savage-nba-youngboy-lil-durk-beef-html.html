Von’s murder has forced rappers to choose a side between Lil Durk and NBA YoungBoy, who are&nbsp;rumored to&nbsp;have&nbsp;a beef.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite the two artists collaborating previously, there are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumors there is a drama</a> between them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The two rappers have not clarified if it is true, and neither are there crystal clear reasons to believe so, but it seems the divide was caused because of all the&nbsp;rappers’ loyalty to Von.&nbsp;</p><h2>NBA YoungBoy and Lil Durk's Beef</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Apparently, on the night of the shoot-out, the Chicago rapper and Quando Rondo were arguing outside an Atlanta nightclub, which was captured on CCTV. After their argument, a fight between rival gangs broke out, leaving Von dead.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to HotNewHipHop, Quando Rondo is close friends with YoungBoy and Lul Tim, who murdered Von. Von was Lil Durk’s close friend and brother, and shortly after his&nbsp;death, Lil Durk reportedly unfollowed Quando Rondo.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>There is no specific reason or event that led to the beef; instead, it’s believed to be a cause of guilty by association.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Before Von’s death, there were rumors that there was drama between YoungBoy and Von after the latter was spotted hanging out with one of YoungBoy’s ex. During an Instagram Live, Von had also accused YoungBoy of lying in his music lyrics. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Von set the record straight during an&nbsp;interview&nbsp;with DJ Akademiks when he confirmed he had no beef with YoungBoy and that it was just the internet making up stories.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>21 Savage Speaks Out on NBA YoungBoy and Lil Durk's Beef</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>21 Savage has now&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoken out</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;the beef between the two rappers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>According to 21 Savage during his<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> interview with DJ Akademiks</a>, even though NBA YoungBoy is one of the hottest rappers right now,&nbsp;no one wanted to work with him, which is why his latest album&nbsp;Sincerely, Kentrell&nbsp;had no features.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The rapper explained that many rappers were loyal to Lil Durk, which is why they did not work with YoungBoy.&nbsp;</p><p>He also revealed that he was loyal to Drake and would not have worked with <a href=# rel=follow>Kanye West</a> on&nbsp;Donda.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>21 Savage</a> iterated a rapper did not have to pick sides, but they had to be a specific type of artist to remain neutral in a feud.&nbsp;</p><p>However, all these theories have not been confirmed by NBA YoungBoy and Lil Durk themselves, and to know the truth, fans can only wait and hope they clarify the matter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Meanwhile, HotNewHipHop has reported that this is a cold war and not about diss records where everything was in the open.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaGphYsCiwsCgnGamkpZ6urvUp56bp6liuaq4jJ2sq6Ndl7Kmso2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazon-dresses-that-look-more-expensive-than-they-are.html><span>←</span><span>11 Amazon dresses that look way more expensive than they are</span></a>
