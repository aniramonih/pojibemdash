However, a potential career in the sport was halted before it could even begin after she had sustained a severe injury.</li><li>To overcome the disappointment of giving up on swimming and running, she had created her YouTube channel in 2018. She had started by uploading videos of her artwork. She eventually gained a lot of recognition for a video where she attempts to cut her hair with craft scissors. Joana had once mentioned in a YouTube video that she was scared of public speaking and found it difficult to communicate with strangers and that her YouTube experience had greatly helped her in tackling these issues.</li><li>In late 2018, she was embroiled in a controversy when some social media users had accused her of buying her subscribers. The suspicion was raised because her subscriber base had grown exponentially in a matter of weeks. Her detractors were eventually proved wrong through YouTube analytics.</li><li>She is a morning person and often states that she gets most of her daily work done when she wakes up at 5:00 a.m.</li><li>Joana has an irrational fear of spiders, darkness, fish, and deep-sea creatures.</li><li>She had once mentioned that her parents would have named her Jesus if she were a boy.</li><p>Featured Image by Joana Ceddia / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqOmmqaRYrCmsMOimGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaymeson-sweeten-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jaymeson Sweeten Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
