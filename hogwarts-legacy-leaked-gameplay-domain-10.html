The user’s profile on Reddit has also been deleted.</p><p>The Reddit leak confirmed several details about the game, particularly the initial hours of gameplay, where the player’s character learns about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and gets sorted into a House.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the subreddit’s users, Warner Bros. has been closely monitoring the threads on the Hogwarts Legacy subreddit and using copyright takedowns to prevent any spoilers from being shared. This is likely to continue until the review embargo for the game is lifted.</p><p>A separate leak from an assurance tester for the game confirmed that despite the massive open world, it is not repetitive.&nbsp;</p><p>Some players had concerns about certain challenges or NPCs being identical to fill in the space, but all leaks suggest that this is not the case. Players can rest assured that the game will not be monotonous.</p><p>A series of images from an artbook for the game “Hogwarts Legacy” were leaked on Twitter and Reddit but have since been deleted. The details revealed in the leaks include the following:</p><ul><li>A character statistic section that showcases the player’s assets, such as name, level, health, defense, offense, clothing, wizarding accessories, equipped mount and broom, and amount of galleons they have.</li><li>Various areas around Hogwarts castle, such as the Divination classroom, Potions classroom, greenhouses, Great Hall, and the famous moving staircases, were displayed in the art book.</li><li>The art book also showcased areas outside of Hogwarts, such as Diagon Alley, though it remains unclear if it is a visitable location in the game.</li><li>A variety of magical creatures, such as Hippogriffs, Thestrals, and Unicorns, were also revealed in the leaks.</li></ul><p>These images were unauthorized leaks, but some remain accessible on Twitter. Players with the Deluxe Edition or Collector’s Edition of “Hogwarts Legacy” will have early access to the game on February 7.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC0zqCumqqkqHqtscaamrJlnJqurLHDZp6apZWluaLFjJ2mppmZo6xyfI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dauood-naimyar-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Dauood Naimyar Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</span></a>
