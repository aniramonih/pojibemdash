<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>WWE Confirms Upcoming Worlds Collide Show In NXT Europe Reveal</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The status of NXT UK has been up in the air for a while, but never more than it has been for the past few days. Reports that the brand might not be long for this world began when <a href=#>upcoming tapings were canceled</a>. A number of the brand's stars then <a href=#>showing up on<strong> NXT 2.0</strong></a> had some worried a few would make the jump to the US following NXT UK's seemingly imminent closure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worlds-collide-is-coming>Worlds Collide Is Coming</h2><p>Turns out rumors that NXT UK is not long for this world were true, but not because the brand is being shut down. It's actually being expanded. As first revealed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> and clarified by WWE, NXT UK will be going on hiatus. When it returns, it will have been rebranded as NXT Europe.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>NXT Heatwave 2022 Recap And Results</a></span></p><p>We haven't seen the last of NXT UK just yet either. As suspected, the reason five of its stars showed up on NXT this week was to begin the build to a show in which wrestlers from each brand will compete against each other. Also revealed via Fox News, WWE has confirmed there will be a Worlds Collide event while NXT UK is on hiatus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nxt-uk.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nxt-uk-will-become-nxt-europe>NXT UK Will Become NXT Europe</h2><p>“We’re going to use the UK talent that we can to go into Worlds Collide and keep that representation out there for as long as we can,” Shawn Michaels revealed. HBK has been heavily involved with both NXT and NXT UK for a number of years. The confrontation between Tyler Bate and Bron Breakker was also mentioned, effectively confirming that will be Worlds Collide's main event.</p><p>The only information not revealed was when exactly Worlds Collide will take place, but it seems likely <a href=#>Clash at the Castle weekend</a> will be the landing spot. There have already been rumors that NXT will be holding a show the night after the event in Cardiff. Even though that leaves just two episodes of NXT to get the card booked, that seems to be the most likely landing spot for the announced Worlds Collide show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>TheSportster Podcast has returned!
