"I believe in God," she revealed to BET. "I pray to Him every single day. There are a lot of things I pray for that He actually gave to me. I'm very spiritual and I believe in Karma."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Hennessy wears a waist trainer. "Staying Healthy & Snatched," she captioned this video, strutting her stuff in the produce aisle of the grocery store modeling one of the corset-like accessories.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/shutterstock_1220104000.jpg><p><span>She also drinks her nutrients.

If it's for charity, I'll do it,'" she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Billboard</span></a><span>. "I chose BronxWorks because I'm from The Bronx, and I got raised in The Bronx, and I just know the struggle and how it is growing up in The Bronx," Hennessy recalls. "I just did it for The Bronx. … I wanted to help the kids and everyone there, because there's not a lot of opportunities out there."</span></p><p><span>Hennessy revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harper's Bazaar </span></a><span>that she is obsessed with skincare. "I want to be one tone, and I want to glow," she said, wiping off her makeup with hydrating cleansing wipes from Neutrogena. "Before I scrub and exfoliate, I like to cleanse my face with the Tatcha cleansing oil." She also confessed she has struggled with acne since she was a kid. "I've been trying face products since I was like 13, 12-years old. I use to break out a lot, especially in my teen years. These are just the products that have been working for me the best."&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoZ2eo7K0v9hmmpqqn6G2r62MoqVmmpGptaq6xmaqrqGkYra0edahnLCvp2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwyneth-paltrow-blythe-danner-red-carpet-premiere-photos-201585.html><span>←</span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow Supports Mom Blythe Danner on Red Carpet: Photos</span></a>
