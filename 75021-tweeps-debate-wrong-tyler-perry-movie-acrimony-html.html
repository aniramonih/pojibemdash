Taraji's character was upset that her ex married someone else despite the fact that she had looked after him for several years and sacrificed a lot to help him grow in his career.</p><p class=align-left>Many thought that Taraji's character took bitterness to another level. Peeps also noted the fact that she's the one who initially called off their relationship when it appeared that the ex wasn't ever going to make it in life.</p><p class=align-left>Others maintained that the guy was wrong to not have the same amount of loyalty and dedication to their relationship that Taraji had.</p>@FirstladyLambo said, "I watched <i>Acrimony </i>again but, this time, I agree (that) the guy was wrong. He really used her. I don't have strength to argue."<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Married couple welcomes 'cute' baby boy after 8 years of waiting</strong></p>@Ross_rori tweeted, "The man wasn't wrong.
