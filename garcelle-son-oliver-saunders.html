We do know that, per Garcelle in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent episode of Real Housewives</a>, she was really proud of Oliver, who had struggled with drug addiction in the past. She also shared that Garcelle and Daniel had Oliver when she was very young. She married Daniel after only two months of dating.</p><p>"I got married really young, and then Oliver came. He was the light of both of our eyes and then he started hanging out with the wrong crowd [and] got into drugs. We did everything that money could offer him. It was really, really difficult to watch him sort of unravel," Garcelle said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Oliver and Sam had their first child in February of 2020.

He's a rapper who goes by the name of BAM! and he's hoping to use his music as a platform.</p><p>"BAM stands for By Any Meanz, because this movement is for anybody who is willing to do what they need to do in order to complete their goals and take care of their kids, By Any Meanz," Oliver writes in his bio on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his personal website</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He credits his mom for working hard "to pursue her dreams and consistently pushes and supports me to do the same."</p><p>"I’ve been writing music since I was seven years old and it has been quite the ride," he writes. "I have been lucky enough to perform with several of my inspirations like Dom Kennedy, Talib Kweli, Kid&nbsp;Ink, Kirko Bangz, Questlove, Skeme, and other artists over the years."&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver previously worked under the name Jayson Rose, but he believes that stage name no longer fits who he is today and believes that BAM! is a better fit.&nbsp;</p><p>"My music is a reflection of me - the good, the bad, and everything in between," he writes. "I hope you stick along for the ride because it’s going to be crazy, but more than worth it!"</p><p>Watch The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills every Wednesday on Bravo at 9 p.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6zr8Slo55lo6S7brvLoq2eql2orra6w56prA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-stevens-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Stevens Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
