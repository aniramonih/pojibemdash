In the caption, Eva wrote: “My lil [sic] man Mikey! Saturday mornings.”</p><p class=dh>As soon as the actress uploaded that slideshow, her fans and followers took to the comment section to praise the baby’s look and share their thoughts.</p><p class=dh>One of them was Instagram user @connielipsey, who <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmD3hEAHjrx/?taken-by=evamarcille">admitted </a>that Michael looked like his father, attorney Michael Sterling Sr. User Nicole Taylor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmD3hEAHjrx/?taken-by=evamarcille">chimed in</a> and said that she loved the baby’s eyes.</p><p class=dh>According to a post shared on Instagram by Eva, who has been working on <i class=ch>The Real Housewives of Atlanta </i>for a while, she welcomed Michael to the world on April 13.

On Christmas, the actress announced that she and her boyfriend had gotten engaged.</p><p class=dh>The proud mother pointed out that she was less anxious during her second pregnancy in comparison to the first one as she learned that she should stop worrying that much.</p><p class=dh>“I remember being pregnant with Marley, and every single thing I'm like, 'What is she doing in there? Was that an elbow? Was that a knee? Is she kicking? Is she trying to get out?' I didn't know what was what. I was wondering if I was drinking something and if it was too cold for her or too hot. I was thinking way too much,” said Eva.</p><p class=dh>At the moment, the actress and her husband have their hands full with two young children and their jobs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnJvbGtiYrK3rYymmKubmaG5pr%2BMbWSmp56ptW6%2FzqdknJmgqba3rdOeqmaglZZ7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./estelle-moultrie-obituary-in-loving-memory-of-estelle-moultrie-death.html><span>←</span><span>Estelle Moultrie Obituary, In Loving Memory Of Estelle Moultrie Death</span></a>
