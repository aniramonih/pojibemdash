<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Landon Farmer Wants A Wife Height: How Tall Is The Oklahoma Rancher?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Landon Heaton is one of the four farmers who starred in the reality show ‘Farmer Wants A Wife’, a spin-off of the British series of the same name. The show follows four single farmers who are looking for love among 32 women who are willing to move to the countryside and live a rural lifestyle. Landon, who owns a 300-acre cattle ranch and a 40-acre farmhouse in Alva, Oklahoma, had to choose between seven potential suitors, and eventually picked Ashley Larea, an executive coordinator from Dallas, Texas. But how tall is Landon, and does his height matter to his partner Ashley?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Landon’s Height and Appearance</h2><p>According to his official bio on the Fox website, Landon is 35 years old and has a mechanical engineering degree. He is described as a “handsome, hardworking, and humble” farmer who loves to travel and experience new cultures. However, his bio does not mention his height, and neither does his Instagram account, where he posts pictures of his farm life, his family, and his travels.</p><p>However, based on his photos and videos, we can estimate that Landon is around 6 feet tall, or 182 cm. He has a muscular build, brown hair, and blue eyes. He often wears cowboy hats, boots, and plaid shirts, which suit his rugged and charming personality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ashley’s Opinion on Landon’s Height</h2><p>Ashley Larea, who is 27 years old and works as an executive coordinator, was one of the seven women who competed for Landon’s heart on ‘Farmer Wants A Wife’. She had an instant connection with him, and even though he was also attracted to another Ashley (Rader), he ultimately chose her as his partner. Ashley and Landon are still together, and they recently attended a watch party to celebrate the finale of the show.</p><p>Ashley seems to be very happy with Landon, and his height does not seem to be an issue for her. She is shorter than him, but not by much, and they look good together. She often posts pictures of them on her Instagram account, where she gushes about how much she loves him and how grateful she is for their relationship. She also praises his qualities, such as his kindness, his humor, his intelligence, and his adventurous spirit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Landon Heaton is one of the successful couples from ‘Farmer Wants A Wife’, a reality show that helps farmers find love. He is a cattle rancher from Oklahoma, who is estimated to be around 6 feet tall. His height does not seem to bother his partner Ashley Larea, who is an executive coordinator from Dallas. They are still together, and they appear to be very happy and in love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX6Gur7DOp2SfmaKisrN51pqlratdlnq4tcWeZKGdmZy1tXnHqK5mrJGhuW610maroZ1dpLitrceopJplopa7pLTEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-kanye-west-serious-about-running-president-2015309.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian: Kanye West &amp;quot;Is Serious&amp;quot; About Running for President</span></a>
