An Alford Plea means that Mack doesn’t admit guilt but thinks the jury would find him guilty of manslaughter because of it.
Mack was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of Waring at his condo on James Island in 2009.
Scarlett Wilson, the lawyer, said her main witness, Heather Kamp, who has bipolar disorder and lied to police about the case, was not trustworthy."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
