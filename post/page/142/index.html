I'll tell you why it sucked. I believe it got one of the lowest buy rates ever because of many reasons. Out of those 6 or 7 matches on the card, only 2 were announced ahead of time. I vaguely recall viewing the card 6 days before the pay pay view, and the only matches announced were Hardy's v MNM and the Elimination Chamber. You do not announce 2 matches ahead of time and expect people to pay for the entire card, unless its Rock vs Cena or something to that extent.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Asa Germann Bio (Wiki)</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>
