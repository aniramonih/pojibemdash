I’m sure some people were like “Go get ‘em, Cougar!” but I didn’t really see the big deal. Sure, Charlie is a cute guy. But Mary-Louise is really cool, so she deserves all of the hot pieces she wants. I was actually more excited about the prospect that <a href=#>Mary-Louise and Jeffrey Dean Morgan had finally broken up for good</a> – that man is fine, and it’s interesting to know he’s single. Cough cough I’m plotting cough.</p><p>TV’s hottest mom has a cute new boyfriend.</p><p>Mary-Louise Parker, 45, has been dating musician Charlie Mars, 35, since early June, sources tell PEOPLE. Parker and the Mississippi-born singer and songwriter were all but inseparable last weekend when the Emmy-nominated Weeds star was in Los Angles to attend the awards.</p><p>Before they started dating, the mother of two was a fan of the up-and-coming artist. Last year, she appeared in the video for “Listen to the Darkside,” the first single off his record Like a Bird, Like a Plane.</p><p>Parker had previously been linked with her one-time Weeds costar Jeffery Dean Morgan.</p><p>[From <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>So, nice story, right? Mary-Louise has found a hot piece/love, and good for her. Not so fast! Defamer and the NYDN are questioning whether Mary-Louise “stole” Charlie from his girlfriend of three years, journalist Lindsey Brown, who works for WTOK, a local Mississippi station. The source of this “homewrecking” charge seems to have come from an e-mail sent to Defamer titled “Cougar Goes Too Far”. The e-mail references the whole Billy Crudup dumping MLP for Claire Danes thing, if you find that relevant. Here’s the e-mail:</p><p>Readers may find it interesting that actress Mary Louise Parker who was dumped late in her pregnancy five years ago went on to rip apart the three year relationship of her new boyfriend Charlie Mars and his then 25 year old Mississippi girlfriend.</p><p>Early June Mars was still in a relationship with news anchor Lindsey Brown who is a journalist in Meridian Mississippi. Mars and Brown met while Brown was finishing up college at the University of Mississippi. It was Brown who helped Mars move through his substance/drug abuse problems he has battled for the last decade.</p><p>You would think a woman who suffered so greatly at the hands of a man would work to make sure other women aren’t betrayed the same way…</p><p>[From <a href=#>E-mail sent to Defamer</a>]</p><p>Uh… right. So, this e-mail was sent by Lindsey Brown, correct? And Lindsey comes off as a bit… crazy, yes? No, I won’t go there. We don’t know what happened. It’s totally possible that Mary-Louise isn’t as cool as I think she is, that she’s some prickly homewrecking cougar who goes out looking for young men that have already been “fixed” by other women. Or Mary-Louise could be so cool that when a “taken” guy meets her, he’s becomes all “Oh, I don’t have a girlfriend, no way. Your hair is pretty.” Or Charlie and Lindsey were already broken up when he began dating Mary-Louise. Whatever.</p><p>Here’s Mary Louise Parker making a quick dash to the security line at Los Angeles International Airport with Charlie Mars on September 21st.
