But while Roger's career went from strength to strength, Mirka was plagued by an injury.</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>Roger has won an incredible record of 20 Grand Slams, which includes eight wins at Wimbledon.</strong></h3><p class=fh>An injury to Mirka's foot in 2002 never healed properly, and she decided to retire from tennis, <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hindustantimes.com/tennis/mirka-roger-federer-s-off-court-champion-made-for-each-other/story-MQ6SK8YUQxiLt3k4pzIJII.html>lend all her support to Roger</a>, and focus on advancing his promising career.</p><p class=fh>The next year, 2003, Roger won the prestigious Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon — his first — and he was just 21. By 2004, Roger was the best player in the world and on his way to becoming a legend.</p><p class=fh>Then, five years later, tennis' golden couple announced that they were growing their family. And surprisingly enough, it was another set of twins, boys this time, whom they named Lenny and Leo.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>LOVING FAMILY</strong></p><p class=fh>Despite his constant traveling to compete in tennis championships around the world, Roger is dedicated to his family and cherishes each moment he spends with them — and is <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/tennis-news/roger-federer-spends-time-with-children-by-making-them-play-tennis.html>teaching them to play tennis.</a></p><p class=fh>He is particularly devoted to his wife Mirka and has revealed that he always sleeps by her side, even when the children are weepy. For Roger, Mirka comes first, and he has said that he would give up his career for her.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>ALL THANKS TO MIRKA</strong></p><p class=fh>Mirka Federer, who was once a top-100 tennis player, became her husband's public relations manager, his greatest fan, and his biggest supporter.

The Swiss champ admits that he has changed thousands of diapers over the years, but he would do it all over again for Mirka.</p><p class=fh>Where Roger goes, his family goes too, which means that the Federer kids are already world-class travelers, flitting from country to country and continent to continent with their famous dad.</p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/09/tennis/roger-federer-exclusive-interview-tennis-spt-intl/index.html>Roger celebrated his 39th birthday</a> on August 8, 2020, and like his friend and fellow tennis champion Serena Williams, also 39, he is rewriting history as far as the longevity of athletic careers goes.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>GIVING BACK</strong></p><p class=fh>According to Forbes, Roger is the highest-paid sportsman in the world with a net worth of US$450 million. The tennis champion also scores big with multi-million dollar endorsement deals with brands like Rolex, Barilla, and Wilson Sporting Goods.</p><p class=fh>Roger, whose mother is South African — he holds dual Swiss and South African citizenship — has donated large sums to help at-risk children in Africa.
