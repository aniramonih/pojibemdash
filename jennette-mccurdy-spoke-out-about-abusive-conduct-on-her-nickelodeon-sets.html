<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>Jennette McCurdy Spoke Out About Abusive Conduct On Her Nickelodeon Sets</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>According to recent reports, iCarly actor Jennette McCurdy has spoken up about her experiences with violent conduct on the sets of her Nickelodeon series. McCurdy talked up about her former terrible experiences with Nickelodeon programs where she reportedly was abused ahead of the August 9 release of her book, I’m Glad My Mom Died.</p><p>The former actress also said that she was given $300,000 in hush money by the network. Jennette McCurdy, 30, alleged in a recent interview with The New York Times that there had been discussions inside the network to pay her the lump amount provided she committed to never publicly discuss her experiences while working on the series.&nbsp;Following her remark regarding unpleasant experiences on the series, many internet users assumed she was referring to iCarly creator Dan Schneider. One such tweet hinted that this was not the first time and that Schneider was not the network’s first CEO to be accused of similar conduct. The tweet stated:</p><p>“Because Dan Schneider is trending, let it be known that this is not the first time Nickelodeon has…”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Since Dan Schneider is trending let it be known this is not the first time for Nickelodeon… <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/10VvUm37ZA</a></p><p>— Jerome! (@JeromeM94Movies) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 5, 2022</a></p><h2>What exactly are the charges leveled against iCarly creator Dan Schneider? Jennette McCurdy’s suggestion of abusive conduct</h2><p>Jennette McCurdy originally starred as Sam Puckett in a Nickelodeon series called iCarly from 2007 until 2012. When the program was relaunched last year, the actress did not return. Following the conclusion of the first season of iCarly, McCurdy returned to her role in Sam and Cat, starring the worldwide music phenomenon Ariana Grande.&nbsp;Jennette McCurdy allegedly alluded to a big shot at Nickelodeon as ‘The Creator’ in her forthcoming biography, I’m Glad My Mom Died. She gave a terrible image of this guy, saying he was “mean-spirited, domineering, and intimidating,” and that he made “mature men and women weep with his insults and humiliation.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jennette-McCurdy-1.png alt="Jennette McCurdy" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s hardly a leap to suppose McCurdy was referring to Dan Schneider, the creator of iCarly and many other Nickelodeon series. Many claims have been filed against the producer and screenwriter over his conduct on Nickelodeon production sets. As a result, it’s quite possible that the iCarly star’s memoirs discussed her terrible experiences on her programs with Schneider.</p><p>In her interview with The Washington Post, Jennette McCurdy also mentioned other unpleasant interactions she had with “the designer.” She stated:</p><p>“It is necessary to discuss. His conduct was so widespread, and so acceptable since everyone was afraid of losing their job. I don’t hold it against any of them. I understand. But everything that transpired in a children’s television series context was really awful. There doesn’t seem to be much of a moral compass there.”</p><p>Jennette McCurdy reportedly endured improper conduct from the person, including an effort to force her to drink alcohol after she turned 18 and shoulder massages, according to the WaPo piece. While it has not been substantiated, this might be why McCurdy was supposedly promised $300,000 by the network to keep her charges quiet.</p><h2>Dan Schneider has already faced claims.</h2><p>Prior to the latest scandal, many sources revealed that Dan Schneider had received numerous accusations of abusive conduct in 2018. Following this, various newspapers stated that Schneider’s contract with Nickelodeon had been terminated due to the allegations leveled against him.&nbsp;Schneider addressed the charges to Deadline last year. He justified himself, saying:</p><p>“I couldn’t, and I wouldn’t have so many respectable people’s long-term friendships and continuous allegiance if I mistreated my performers of any age, particularly kids.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jennette-McCurdy-1.jpeg alt="Jennette McCurdy" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>People may find him tough because of his “high standards,” according to the producer. He went on to say:</p><p>“I never connected with actors in any manner that should make anybody uncomfortable, texting or otherwise.”</p><p>While there have been multiple reports of Schneider’s abusive and improper conduct, no serious public complaints have been made against the producer.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqaemsG1sYymmpytopnGbr%2FPqKKeZZ%2BqwW6twaisrWWRl8K0tdWeZJynnpnCpMCMqKVmoJWneq%2B1wqScpaeUmryvedKeq6xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-johnsons-ride-the-eagle-is-the-quiet-little-indie-to-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Johnsons 'Ride the Eagle Is the 'Quiet Little Indie' to Watch</span></a>
