And what better show to turn to for inspiration than Gilmore Girls? Not only would it be amazing to pretend to be Rory or Lorelai for a night, but choosing a <a href=# class=T3D>creative Gilmore Girls Halloween costume</a> should be relatively simple — the characters wear regular clothes, so it's not like you have to buy anything crazy to look authentic. Because, really, who has time to drop $150 on their Halloween costume?</p><p>Gilmore Girls is an excellent choice if it's one of your favorite shows, but the other great thing about it is that there are so many character options. You've got Rory and Lorelai, of course (their early 2000s characters as well as their 2016 characters), but there are also a ton of smaller characters with interesting and distinct personalities who would make clever costumes. The fictional people in Stars Hollow would actually make an amazing group costume, so it's even something you could do as a theme with a few friends. Whatever option you choose, it's bound to get a lot of compliments. To get you started, here are some creative Gilmore Girls Halloween costume ideas you'll want to put together right now:</p><p>Check out the entire 'What's Up, Boo?' series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.</p><h2>1. Lorelai And Rory Gilmore</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Doing a costume with your bestie? You can't go wrong with old-school Lorelai and Rory, the way we knew them in the very beginning. For Lorelai, opt for a tight pencil skirt and turtleneck, a leather jacket, and a pair of knee-high boots. For Rory, a plaid skirt, button down shirt, blue blazer, and yellow backpack get the job done.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>2. Luke Danes</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>If you're looking for a quick last-minute costume, you really can't find anything easier than Luke Danes. His classic outfit of a backwards baseball cap, a plaid shirt, and jeans are probably things you already have in your closet. And thanks to Etsy, you can even find Luke's Diner shirts, mugs, and pins.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>3. Lane Kim</h2><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Want to get a little bit more clever with your Gilmore Girls ideas? Lane is a great option, mainly because her costume is so fun, especially if you're doing Lane from her high school band days. A black mesh top, ripped jeans, and a studded belt are easy to find. Add colorful hair extensions and carry around drumsticks to be authentic Lane.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>4. Lorelai And Luke</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>If you're searching for a cute and unique couples costume, Luke and Lorelai are such a great, easy option. I prefer the couple from one of their adorable snow scenes, like this one when they went ice skating on Lorelai's front lawn. For Luke, you'll need a plaid shirt and a baseball cap, as well as a green jackt. For Lorelai, a blue top, brown jacket, cute beanie, and colorful scarf will work.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>5. Paris, Madeleine, And Louise</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Finding a group costume for three people can be tough, but Paris, Madeleine, and Louise are perfect. You'll all need matching plaid skirts and Oxford shoes (or loafers). One of you can be Paris with a crisp blazer, another can be Madeline with a blue sweater, and another can be Louise with a gray cardigan.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>6. Sookie St. James</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Dressing as Sookie is super easy — all you need to do is get your hands on a chef's coat. Sookie from the older seasons was always wearing a chef's coat and a bandana, so you'll be super comfortable. Add some bandages as an ode to her infamous clumsiness.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2></h2><h2>7. Jess Mariano</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Dressing as everyone's favorite Stars Hallow bad boy couldn't be easier — all you need is a leather jacket, a gray hoodie, and a pair of boots. Carry around Howl by Allen Ginsberg, one of his favorite books, to get really clever.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>8. Birthday Party Rory</h2><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Get specific with your GG knowledge and dress as Rory did for her epic 16th birthday party. Who could forget this classic scene where we were introduced to so many of the lovable Stars Hallow residents? To channel Rory on her b-day, throw on some colorful boas and make sure to wear a birthday crown.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>9. Rory And Logan</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>If you're Team Logan (I, personally, will be Team Jess forever), then you can do Rory and Logan as a cute couples or best friend costume. Find your fanciest ball gown (if you happen to have one laying around) and a blue scarf. Tie a gold sash around your waist and put on some heels. For Logan, all your partner needs is a suit and bow tie. And obviously, you both need umbrellas.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>10. Emily And Richard</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>In my opinion, this is the cutest couples costume you could be for Halloween: Emily and Richard. For Richard, all your partner will need is a suit and bow tie — bonus points for the pocket square. For Emily, you'll need a cardigan, pencil skirt, and a pearl necklace. Bonus points for the Chanel perfume.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>11. The Town Troubadour</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Get a little bit more creative and dress as one of Stars Hallow's many colorful characters. The Town Troubadour is a cute one because he's so unique. Wear green pants, a denim jacket, and glasses. Figure out a way to hang a microphone around your neck, and if you can, walk around with a guitar.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>12. Revival Lorelai And Rory</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Old school Lorelai and Rory might be more well-known, but revival Lorelai and Rory are a little more fun and colorful. Channel Rory's adult vibes with printed shorts and a matching tank, and add a colorful turban headband and loose vest. For Lorelai, a printed dress or wrap dress works perfectly, and don't forget the straw hat and sunglasses. Oh, and obviously two matching lace parasols.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>13. Lorelai And Emily</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>It doesn't get much more classic Gilmore Girls than Lorelai and Emily from season one. For Lorelai, wear denim cut-offs, a tie dye shirt, and cowboy boots, topped with a long overcoat. For Emily, be sure to get prim and proper with a pencil skirt, sweater, and pearl earrings.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>14. Dance Lorelai And Rory</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Warner Bros</p></figure><p>Remember the infamous dance scene, when Dean rudely broke up with Rory and she cried it out with her mom in public? Aside from all the drama, their outfits were very cute. Grab some vintage dresses, put your hair in victory rolls, and don't forget the red lipstick - and coffee. Lots of coffee.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><h2>15. Halloween Rory</h2><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Get a little meta and dress up as Rory dressing up as GoGo from Pulp Fiction. You can wear a plaid skirt, knee socks, and a blazer, and don't forget the weapon.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jpypnpmknsOmecaio6anopp6qLXRpapmm5%2Bowba5xGagnZ2RqHqnu9Fmn5qknKTEprHNZmlpaWdiwamt02acr52irnqnrc1mrqKknGK5sMLEZm5tb2Fn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cody-longo-net-worth-earnings-the-rich-life-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cody Longo Net Worth: Earnings &amp;amp; The Rich Life</span></a>
