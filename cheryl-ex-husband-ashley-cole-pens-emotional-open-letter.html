The 36-year-old football star, who <a class=hm-link href=#>welcomed a baby boy</a> with his girlfriend <strong>Sharon Canu</strong> last year after a whirlwind romance, penned an emotional open letter, revealing the pure joy his child has brought to his life. "I've been incredibly fortunate to have most things I've wanted in life: cars, houses, watches, clothes," he wrote. "Coming from east London with not a lot growing up, and a mum looking after two boys alone, life wasn't always easy. So of course it's easy lose your way in life sometimes, to forget about the things that are most important."</p><p id=enVlyGjF5Y-iD><a class=hm-link href=#>VIDEO: Cheryl shows off her gorgeous baby bump</a></p><p id=ePaP0ZSNUVhT1 data-wc=125>The sporting ace celebrated his son's first birthday on Tuesday, and he took the opportunity to open up about fatherhood. "But this morning I woke up to something that exceeds anything I've ever had before: a smile that never goes away," he added. "Every day I wake up to the most beautiful thing I could dream of: a son that makes my heart melt, a son that never stops smiling, a son that can make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in, a son that I'm proud of, a son I watch fall asleep because I never want to leave him, a son who reminded me what's most important in life. Happy 1st birthday son I will always be with you forever."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on X</a><p id=edHFJGEP0UNJh><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Cheryl and Liam celebrate one-year anniversary</a></p><p id=e9ntasjBjqMcK data-wc=75>The heartfelt post comes as his ex-wife <a class=hm-link href=#>Cheryl confirmed her pregnancy</a>. The former golden couple tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in July 2006 - but split less than four years later amid reports he was unfaithful. Last week, the former judge proudly showed off her baby bump in a new campaign photo and video for L'Oreal and The Prince's Trust. Cheryl, 33, cradled her <a class=hm-link href=#>blossoming bump</a> as she spoke about self-worth for the new confidence campaign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b10546f94ada-cheryl-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=emfPjtxM10UaY data-wc=9><strong>Cheryl and her ex-husband Ashley Cole split in 2010</strong></p><p id=e3zAioHEA5guI data-wc=80>Although the singer and her boyfriend Liam are yet to publicly comment on becoming parents for the first time, their romance is proving to be very strong as Cheryl has reportedly moved out of her Hertfordshire home and into Liam's house in Surrey. The A-list couple first met in 2008 when he was an aspiring singer on and she was a judge. They had been secretly dating since December 2015, shortly after Cheryl split from her <a class=hm-link href=#>second husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini</a>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
