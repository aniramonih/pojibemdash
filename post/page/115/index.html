Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last yearThen all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Cause one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely
I still have dreams, they're not the same</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sharkboy Dream Song lyrics</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

Close your eyes, shut your mouth
Dream a dream and get us out
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream[Verse 2]
Hit the hay, fast asleep
Dream a dream, you little bleep
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

Just relax, lay about
Or my fist will put you out
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
