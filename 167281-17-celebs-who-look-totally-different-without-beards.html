Yet while it's true that the singer certainly did cause a few "say what now?" double-takes thanks to his clean-shaven face, I happen to think he looks handsome any which way, and was totally fine with the change. But there's no question that Drake without a beard looks <i>crazy</i> different than his normal self, and interestingly enough, the "One Dance" singer is just one of many celebrities who look like new people when they <a href=# class=T3D>aren't rocking some facial hair, particularly beards.</a></p><p>Sometimes, having a beard can make a person look even more handsome and sophisticated, and other times, it distracts from their features. But no matter what, the male celebs on the list, all of whom have shaved their beards at some point or another, look so, so different when they're not rocking facial hair that your mind will definitely be blown when you see the below pictures. Check out the 17 celebs here who look crazy different without their signature beards, and you'll see why facial hair can sometimes make <i>all</i> the difference when it comes to a star's recognizability.</p><h3>1. Drake</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Elsa/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images</p></figure><p>It only makes sense to start this list with the man who may or may not have changed the way we see beards on celebrities. When Drake has a beard, all I want to is to gently stroke it while he cries onto my shoulder. When Drake <i>doesn't</i> sport a beard, I kind of just want to go away and cry by myself — preferably in a corner. Funnily enough, though, even when Drizzy doesn't have a beard, he has some 5 o'clock shadow nonetheless.</p><h3>2. Seth Rogen</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Cindy Ord/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>When Rogen doesn't have facial hair, it feels like he's not even the same person.</p><h3>3. Kanye West</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Harry How/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Yeezy's got subtle facial hair, so well groomed and styled one may not even notice that it's there. He's always doing something with it — sometimes leaving just a mustache, or maybe a little goatee action. But the moment it completely comes off, dude looks like a totally different human.</p><h3>4. Jeff Bridges</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>There are some men who are born to have great beards, and some who must have beards thrust upon them. Jeff Bridges falls into both of those categories. Without a beard, Bridges looks like his evil twin, Beff Jridges. A beard with that much body is a terrible thing to waste.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>5. Aziz Ansari</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Ansari is the classic example of a beard working to make a guy look his age. Without a beard, the baby-faced 33-year-old looks to be in his 20s, but slap a beard on the guy and he's suddenly a grown man.</p><h3>6. Paul Rudd</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Jemal Countess/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Rudd is an incredibly sweet-faced guy, but pop a beard on him, and he becomes less adorable and a tad more hunky.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Jason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>7. Antonio Banderas</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Beard or no beard, everyone knows Banderas looks best in a mask (though a beard is <i>also</i> definitely a wonderful option for the actor).</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>8. Willie Nelson</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Nelson is known for his braids, beard, and altogether hippie country vibe. But the celebrity hasn't always rocked facial hair. When he's beardless, its almost hard to be sure it's Nelson, but the way to be certain is by listening for that distinctive voice.</p><p></p><h3>9. Idris Elba</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Elba has the most beautiful smattering of salt and pepper in that beard. He also looks great without it. What a guy.</p><h3>10. Chris Pine</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Pine is the classic example of a guy looking softer and more adorable with a beard. Without it, he's a bit more intimidating. Suddenly he's all angular, and those eyes are pretty intense.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Francois Nel/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>11. Donald Glover</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>I can't be the only person who feels a very real and visceral need to run my fingers through that beard, right? But really, having a beard seriously makes Glover seem three times more mature and a zillion times more handsome.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>12. Jon Hamm</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>ADRIAN SANCHEZ-GONZALEZ/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Did Hamm invent the beard? No man truly knows the answer to this question.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Mark Davis/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>13. John Legend</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>TIZIANA FABI/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>In this case, I gotta say that beardless wins. This man looks so dapper when he's clean-shaven, but with a beard, he looks less mature and way more casual.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Charley Gallay/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>14. Ryan Reynolds</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Reynolds with a beard makes for a mature, sexy look, but without one, he seems barely old enough to be out of college.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>15. Will Smith</h3><p>We all knew Smith before he was a bearded gentleman, back in his <i>Fresh Prince</i> days, but with a beard, he seems truly like the mature, attractive adult we all knew he'd become someday.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>GERARD BURKHART/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>16. Fred Armisen</h3><p>Armisen uses facial hair to change characters ,so it should come as no surprise that when you slap a goatee on him, dude looks like a completely different human. Even if it's just fake body hair he glued on for a role.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Cindy Ord/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h3>17. Chris Rock</h3><p>Rock is one of those guys who can do anything, but with a beard he seems much more like he can handle the serious stuff.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>A beard is a terrible thing to waste, but these celebrities manage to look pretty OK with or without. It might be shocking sometimes when they change up their look, but we can always count on our favorite stars to keep on keeping on regardless of what facial hair they sport.</p><p><i>Images: Giphy (6)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygpZrb2plYWx6pLHLnpmsZaedvG64zqiiZqyfqa6tuNhmm6Kelpq%2FprrTZq6irJikwrV5wZ6Yq5yj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./royal-couples-age-differences-prince-harry-meghan-markle-princess-anne-timothy-laurence.html><span>←</span><span>15 royal couples with unexpected age differences - and one is 32 years!</span></a>
