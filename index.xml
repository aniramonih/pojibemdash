ミュージックステーションに出演した際は、自身でブルーレイを買うほどのジャニーズファンであることを公言し、ジャニーズとヒゲダンの両ファンがざわつきました。
また本格的なサウナの資格を取得するなど、ジャニファンの反面、ちょっと渋い趣味も持っています。
そして、俳優の三浦春馬さんとの意外は交友などもあったり、なにかとミステリアスな方です。
今日は小笹大輔さんのジャニーズ愛と、サウナ愛、そして三浦春馬さんとの関係について書いてみたいと思います。
小笹大輔がジャニーズファン！King &amp;amp; PrinceとジャニーズWEST推しで中間淳太推し
小笹大輔さんのジャニーズ好きが明らかになったのは2019年10月18日に出演した『ミュージックステーション 3時間スペシャル』（テレビ朝日系）の中でした。
番組ではOfficial髭男dismとKing &amp;amp; Princeが共演し、トークのコーナーでKing &amp;amp; Princeの永瀬廉さんがヒゲダンの楽曲について語った後に、小笹大輔さんがキンプリとジャニーズWESTが好きであることが語られました。
King &amp;amp; Princeの永瀬廉は「僕は『Sweet Tweet』が好きで。中でも『115万キロのフィルム』が好きで、お風呂、トイレ、場所関係なく歌っちゃいますね」と語った。
ヒゲダンの小笹大輔（Gt）が「僕もキンプリさん大好きで。コンサートのブルーレイとかも持ってて……」と話し始め、「あとは（ジャニーズ）WESTさんも、プライベートで遊びに行った会場で神山（智洋）さんと（藤井）流星さんに『ファンなんです』って声かけさせていただいて」とジャニーズトークは止まらず、推しについては「（中間）淳太くんが好きで。淳太くんがみんなに蹂躙されている様が好きという意味で、箱推しなんです」と熱烈なジャニーズ愛を伝えた。
まとめると小笹大輔さんは、
・キンプリのブルーレイを買うほどファン
・プライベートで行ったジャニーズWESTのライブで神山と藤井にファンと挨拶をした
・個人としてはジャニーズWESTの中間淳太さんの推しである
ということです。
ちなみに小笹大輔さんがジャニーズWESTの中間淳太さんのことを「淳太くん」と呼んだことで、番組を見ていた多くのジャニーズファンがSNSで小笹さんが本物のファンであることを実感したそうです。
（ジャニーズは昔から先輩後輩も関係なく「君付け」で呼ぶならわしがあり、ファンもそれを習ってジャニーズタレントを呼ぶ時には、「君付け」で呼んでいる）
最後に簡潔にまとめると、小笹大輔さんはジャニーズのグループではジャニーズWESTとKing &amp;amp; Princeが好きで、メンバーはジャニーズWESTの淳太くん（中間淳太）推しということです。
小笹大輔と藤原聡は学生時代に嵐のコピーをしていた 小笹さんがロックに目覚めた当初は兄と一緒にバンクやメロコアをコピーして楽しんでたそうですが、ボーカルの藤原聡さんと出会った頃にはポップミュージックなど多彩にコピーして楽しんでたそうです。
小笹大輔さんは学生時代の時点ですでにジャニーズが好きで、ボーカルの藤原聡さんも好きだったそうです。
当時の小笹大輔さんと藤原聡さんは嵐のコピーバンドをしていたそうです。
コピーしていたと語られた曲は、「きっと大丈夫」「ワイルドアットハート」「Happiness」「サクラ咲ケ」「A・RA・SHI」などです。
どこかで演奏して欲しいですが、権利関係が複雑なので簡単には観れなさそうです。
2019年にヒゲダンで紅白歌合戦出場が決定した際には、嵐に会うのが楽しみだと仰っていました。
嵐が活動休止する最終日にチラッと共演できたのも、何かの縁ですね。
小笹大輔の髪型は元キンプリの岩橋玄樹を意識してる？似てる件 キンプリが大好きな小笹大輔さんですが、実は過去にキンプリに所属していたあるメンバーにそっくりだと言われています。
2018年の年末に活動休止し、2021年からはソロとして活動されている岩橋玄樹さんです。
髪型が雰囲気が似てるということで、何かしら影響を受けてる可能性があります。
岩橋さんは小笹さんと同じく身長が小さくて色白で細く中性的であります。
ヒゲダンがメディアに登場して小笹さんが言及できるようになった時期には岩橋さんは活動してない状態だったので、仮に好きだったとしても名前を出しにくい存在でありました。
実は小笹さんは岩橋さん一番好きでヘアスタイルまで影響されているというのが勝手な憶測です
小笹大輔と三浦春馬に交友関係？ Official髭男dismは2019年に紅白歌合戦に出場し、バンドの名前を全国区にしました。
その2019年に、俳優・三浦春馬さんと仲良しであることが発覚していました。
三浦春馬さんが2019年12月1日にOfficial髭男dismのライブを観に行ったとして、メンバーみんなで撮影した写真をアップしました。
Official髭男dism の八王子ライブ行ってきました！ 本当に素晴らしかった。今もメンバーが奏でるメロディと聡くんの歌声が耳から離れない… 大ちゃんライブ誘ってくれてありがとねー！ 刺激になったよ！#誠さん#半目#使ってごめんなさい。#でも#可愛らしいと思ったからさ#載せちゃったよね
三浦春馬さんは「Official髭男dism Tour 19/20 -Hall Travelers-」の東京公演（2019年11月30日：オリンパスホール八王子）を鑑賞したとされ、そのライブ後のオフショットを投稿されました。
メンバーとほとんど同い歳でありますが、三浦春馬さんはハッシュタグで「可愛らしいと思ったからさ」と加えて、なにかとお兄さんの風格を出していました。
小笹大輔は2019年5月に三浦春馬の「キンキブーツ」の舞台を観に行っていた 三浦春馬さんのヒゲダンのライブを観に行ったのは2019年の年末でありましたが、実はその手前に小笹大輔さんが三浦春馬さんの舞台を見に行っていたのです。
そのことは小笹さんがインスタグラムにアップしていました。
キンキーブーツ、素晴らしき舞台でした。
ものを創ること、自分らしくあること、誰かを愛すること、人生のすべてがそこにあったと言えるくらい金言の宝庫。</description></item><item><title> Travis Scott Fans Freak Out Over Postponed Show, Shatter Glass Door</title><link>/travis-scott-concert-postponed-fans-crazy-freak-out-break-glass.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/travis-scott-concert-postponed-fans-crazy-freak-out-break-glass.html</guid><description>Play video content ASTRO-DISASTER 8:05 AM PT -- Tulsa PD tells TMZ ... no arrests were made and no injuries were reported from the chaos.

Leaving boiled peanuts out at room temperature for more than 24 hours can cause them to go bad. Because of the high moisture content in cooked peanuts, they may degrade very fast. If you have any leftover boiled peanuts, you should store them in the refrigerator or freezer. When stored in the refrigerator, boiled peanuts should be safe to consume within 7 to 10 days.
