I watched regularly back then and totally loved his character. Yummy! I’m trying to remember some history: did Jagger leave GH prior to Jason Morgan? I remember that Karen was with Jason and left him for Jagger. Was there bad blood between Jason Q. and Jagger? Am I remembering that correctly?</p><p>If Jagger does return to GH, what do you think his relationship with Jason will be like now? I have yet to watch my DVR’d NS Season II, but I heard that Jagger was FBI. I guess that is one answer, right? Thanks.</p><p><strong>Ssloo</strong> I’m going to do my best to get the memory working here. LOL</p><p>Yes Jason and Karen were dating at the time that she met Jagger but there was no bad blood between Jagger and Jason when Jagger and Karen started dating. Jagger had left the show before Jason Morgan. As far as his relationship with Jason now it’s hard to say as Jason most likely doesn’t remember a lot about him,if anything at all. I don’t imagine they’d be on each other’s side for much (as you stated, Jagger is FBI) but it would be great to see them have a scene together just for Jagger to see who Jason has become.</p><p>Heck, to have the two of them onscreen together again would be HOT!!</p><p>The Jagger/Karen thing happened right before I started watching GH, but I don’t think Jason got too mad about it because nothing really got to Jason Q that much. I think he and Brenda were almost a rebound couple over it, but it didn’t happen.</p><p>Jason Morgan would have no idea who Jagger was, unless Sonny told him. Were he an Sonny still tight he would hate Jagger out of loyalty to Sonny. If Jagger is a cop or FBI they would have to be enemies.</p>Quote <strong>aerinha</strong>: The Jagger/Karen thing happened right before I started watching GH, but I don't think Jason got too mad about it because nothing really got to Jason Q that much.

Was Jagger mad at Sonny for getting Stone involved in his business? Sorry I just don’t remember. But if Jason does know about Jagger, Robin might have told Jason all about Jagger and Karen when Robin and Jason were together.</p>Quote <strong>liasonfourever</strong>: Quote <strong>aerinha</strong>: The Jagger/Karen thing happened right before I started watching GH, but I don't think Jason got too mad about it because nothing really got to Jason Q that much.

Sonny got Karen hooked on pills and turned her into a stripper so Jagger hated him. Sonny hated Jagger because Karen dumped him to go back to Jagger. Plus Jagger never liked Stone working for Sonny.</p>Quote <strong>aerinha</strong>: Quote <strong>liasonfourever</strong>: Quote <strong>aerinha</strong>: The Jagger/Karen thing happened right before I started watching GH, but I don't think Jason got too mad about it because nothing really got to Jason Q that much.
