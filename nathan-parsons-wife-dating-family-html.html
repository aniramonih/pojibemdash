Nathan grew up in a family of five alongside his two brothers- Robert Parsons and Jared Parsons. Although not much is known about his parents, his&nbsp;father worked as a civilian supervisor at a military base. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Budding Actor:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Ty Simpkins Dating, Girlfriend, Parents, Net Worth" rel=follow>Ty Simpkins Dating, Girlfriend, Parents, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Nathan's family moved to the United States when he was very young. At first, they relocated to Colorado but eventually settled in Texas. And it was in Texas, where Nathan completed his high school&nbsp;at St. Andrew's Episcopal School.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After graduating high school, Nathan attended the University of Southern California. But unfortunately, he dropped out of college after a year and a half as he was too eager to test the waters of the real world.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career, Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>After dropping out of college without graduation, it was not a steady ride to fame for Nathan. He&nbsp;made his first screen appearance in&nbsp;the 2007 horror-comedy Teeth. After many&nbsp;minor roles in TV&nbsp;shows, he finally got his big break&nbsp;in 2009&nbsp;from&nbsp;General Hospital.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After that, he has appeared in the hit vampire series&nbsp;True Blood and The Originals. Further, he also had a recurring role on the ABC Family series, Bunheads.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The good looking actor of height 6 feet (1.83&nbsp;m) for sure has made a commendable career in acting.&nbsp;In addition to his handsome face and masculine built, Nathan also has an exciting feather tattoo on his biceps. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>As for his net worth, with an average actor's salary of $50,000 per year, Nathan undoubtedly boasts a decent wealth. Moreover, with&nbsp;new projects like Lionsgate/Kingdom Studios’ faith-based drama, I Still Believe in his kitty,&nbsp;Nathan's net worth is more likely to increase.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Nathan Parsons Wife, Girlfriend</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Over his decade long career in the industry, Nathan has garnered a substantial number of admirers for himself. Needless to say, his admirers are always keen to know about his relationships and dating affairs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>However, to their dismay, the 31 years old actor has kept his love life pretty secluded. Although the Originals actor has kept his personal life extremely private, he is definitely not married. So, a wife is out of the question.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You May Like:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Joel Fry Married, Parents, Net Worth, Now" rel=follow>Joel Fry Married, Parents, Net Worth, Now</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite being extremely secretive about his real love life, he has not been able to escape linkup rumors with his on-screen wife, Haley (portrayed by Jeanine&nbsp;Mason). The duo's on-screen chemistry on the show Originals was&nbsp;so strong that it ignited a whirlwind of rumors about their link-up.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Nathan Parsons with Jeanine Mason in 2019 Oscar Parties </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;justjared)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite all such rumors, both Nathan and Jeanine have always insisted that the two are incredibly close friends and nothing more.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As Nathan has never mentioned his relationship with a girlfriend or a female companion, naturally, questions are rising regarding his sexuality.
