Now that past could be manifesting itself in their most recent feud.</p><p>The WWE Universal Champion jumped on Instagram to provide a warning for his Royal Rumble opponent. They know each other well and although it’s hard to deny that Daniel Bryan is one of the greatest of all time, now it’s Wyatt’s time.</p><p>In 2014 I had one of my favorite bouts of my career against Daniel Bryan at The Royal Rumble. Bryan was red hot, it was his time. He went on to main event WrestleMania and become the champ. Deservedly so, Bryan is without a doubt the best I’ve ever been in the ring with. Fast forward to 2020…… The Fiend vs Daniel Bryan at The Royal Rumble. Bryan is like myself in the fact that no one said, “This is a guy we should build our companies future around!”, the first time we walked in the door. WE had to scratch and claw, outwork, out talk, out perform everyone on the pedestal in front of us. Daniel Bryan is one of the greatest of all time. But this is not his time, it’s mine. This is when my name becomes synonymous with the industry I have given my life to. I want to thank you Bryan for the blood we’ve spilled together over the years. But understand, for me, this is my war worth dying for. The choice isn’t mine to make. Good luck</p><p>We’ll have to see how the Royal Rumble will kick off the road to WrestleMania 36. It could be a big night for The Fiend and Daniel Bryan. It certainly seems like Bray Wyatt is ready to take Daniel Bryan to the limit in Houston on January 26th.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>December 28, 2019 7:01 pm</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
