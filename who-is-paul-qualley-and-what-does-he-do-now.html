Paul was originally from Missoula, Montana, though he was born in the De Pere, Wisconsin, part of the United States. While he is an American by nationality, his ancestry is traceable to Norway.</p><p>The son of Lee James Qualley and his wife, Patricia Ann Rondou, Paul is believed to be an only child as there is no record of any siblings for him.</p><p>The former model attended a local high school in his place of birth, Wisconsin, where he emerged as a sports stand-out majoring in football. Proceeding to Californian State University Fullarton on a football scholarship, Paul graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in 1980.</p><h2><strong>What Does Paul Qualley Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Paul Qualley is currently a rancher, but he was once into modeling and also delved into the movie world as an actor.</p><h3><strong>Paul First Tried His hands at Modeling</strong></h3><p>Standing at the height of 6 feet 2 inches with beautiful blue eyes, Qualley stood out among his peers, and it came as no surprise that his family encouraged him to go into modeling.</p><p>No one has delved into the ins and outs of his career as a fashion model, but there was a time he worked and walked for the clothing brand known as GAP in the mid-1980s. It was while working with GAP that Paul met the woman who would become his wife.</p><p>GAP is quite big in the fashion world, with its assets valued at a whopping $1 billion in 2022. His association with a company as big as GAP opened inroads into other modeling gigs, including runways and several commercials. Though he did very well as a model, Paul never bagged any prestigious awards in the field.</p><p>Despite the early success he recorded in modeling, Paul Qualley took the conscious decision to quit the runway and try his hands at other ventures.</p><h3><strong>He Recorded a Brief Gig in Acting</strong></h3><p>The former model was at the height of his career on the runway when he had a rare stint in acting. In 2009, he became part of the cast of the sci-fi movie, “Moon Europa.” The film marked the beginning and end of the former model’s foray into the acting industry.</p><h3><strong>Paul Qualley is Listed as a Musician</strong></h3><p>Only very few people know that Paul Qualley is also talented in music. However, he didn’t give much time to his singing career. To date, he has only ever recorded one track entitled “Please Please,” which hit the music stand during the 1980s. The former model has been severally spotted with his guitar.</p><h3><strong>Paul is currently a Rancher</strong></h3><p>Right from his growing-up years, Paul has always harbored a passion for ranching. Thus, he was happy to go and explore his childhood dreams of becoming a rancher after he gave up modeling.</p><p>His family already had a ranch located in Montana, which made things easier for him. Paul has been growing his family ranch since he turned 40 and has remained there to date. He also has something to do with the contracting business.</p><h2><strong>Paul Qualley was Andie MacDowell’s Husband</strong></h2><p>Paul Qualley has only been married once in his life, and according to the records, he is the former husband of celebrity actress and former runway queen Andie MacDowell. The duo met in the line of duty when they worked together on a commercial for the GAP brand during the mid-1980s.</p><p>It was love at first sight for the couple as they wasted no time in commencing a relationship. The duo took their dalliance to the ultimate conclusion in 1986 when they exchanged wedding vows.</p><h3><strong>They Have Three Children</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/9a694703ac2908c1-e1672908072805.jpg><p>The details of Paul and Andie’s married life are not readily available but going by reports, the couple’s union was blessed with three children. The eldest among them is their son Justin Qualley who was born on the 14th of August 1986.</p><p>From what is obvious, Justin is the only child of Paul Qualley, who did not forge a career in the entertainment industry. He currently lives in Montana, where he works with a real estate company as a realtor.</p><p>Justin soon became a big brother to Rainey Qualley, who joined the Qualley brood on the 11th of March 1990. Popularly known by the stage name Rainsford, Paul’s first daughter works as a singer cum actress.</p><p>The couple’s last child is a daughter named Sarah Margaret; she announced her entrance on the 23rd of October 1994 and works as an actress, model, and ballet dancer.</p><p>Paul Qualley’s union with Andie lasted till 1999, when they decided to go their separate ways. To date, nothing has been said about the couple’s reasons for splitting.</p><h3><strong>Did Paul Qualley Remarry?</strong></h3><p>From what is perceivable, Paul Qualley is not married to anybody. However, we must acknowledge the fact that the former model has been living his life away from the limelight post-divorce. Thus, it isn’t easy to obtain proof of his current relationship status. Many have concluded that he might be dating and keeping it all under wraps.</p><p>However, the story is different for his ex-wife, MacDowell, who has been raising their children in North Carolina. After their divorce, she had a short gun marriage with Rhett Hartzog, her former schoolmate. The duo tied the nuptials on the 10th of November 2001 but called it quit in 2004.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Paul Qualley?</strong> Paul Qualley is a contractor, rancher, and former model/musician based in the US.
