Youngsters temporarily develop this habit if they are lonely or feeling insecure. In the past siblings used to sleep hugging each other. Now a days we all sleep in separate rooms .Old habits seldom die.</p><p>Holding onto a body pillow at night can replicate this sensation and create a sense of peace as you doze off. The emotional element associated with hugging and holding allows your mind to stop racing, instead of focusing on the quiet around you as you relax your muscles.</p><p>In their fantasy they are hugging the one they love. Marilyn Monroe used to hug a pillow when she went to sleep. In her mind, it was often Clark Gable, whom she fantasied was her real father. (See my book, Marilyn Monroe: On the Couch.)</p><h2>Why do you put a pillow on your chest?</h2><p>Sometimes when you have<strong> pneumonia or some other chest infection</strong> the<strong> pillow can help relieve pressure and help your recovery.</strong> Open heart surgery patients often use the same method when recovering from surgery to help the healing process.</p><p>If you’re asking if your boyfriend prefers cuddling with a pillow than you, that may be true. Think about it, pillows are squishy and comfy and you can cuddle them whenever and however you want because it’s a pillow. People are more difficult and bonier and sometimes you don’t get the right position with them.</p><h2>Why do people hug their pillows?</h2><p>Pillows make you feel comfortable, both physically and mentally. People with anxiety have difficulty staying present and acknowledging the essence of their environment. If you’re an anxiety sufferer, hugging a pillow may help you relax and fall asleep faster.</p><p>When you hug someone,<strong> your body releases chemicals that help increase your bond with that person.</strong> An individual can recreate the same sensations while hugging a pillow during their sleep. One of these chemicals is the hormone and neurotransmitter oxytocin, which is released by your brain’s hypothalamus.</p><p><strong>Stimulating the release of oxytocin by hugging a pillow</strong> can help calm your mind down, allowing you to sleep more soundly. Furthermore, given oxytocin’s ability to relieve social anxiety and build feelings of trust, it also can reduce your stress.</p><p>This is a result of your abdomen resting on your major blood vessels and intestines. Pregnant women are advised to sleep on their sides, and hugging a body pillow can help them maintain this position in their sleep. Pillow hugging also makes you feel warmer and more comfortable during your slumber.</p><p>When you sleep on your back,<strong> the base of your tongue and soft palate collapse to the back of your throat,</strong> resulting in a vibrating sound (snoring) while you sleep. In a study conducted by Oksenberg et al ., nearly 54% of snorers were positional snorers. In other words, they only snored while lying on their backs.</p><p>For babies and young children, sleeping can be the most challenging part of the day<strong> as they have to let go from their parent or caretaker who has been soothing them constantly, often by holding them close to their bodies.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This remains constant during adulthood, but we hug a pillow instead. The way you sleep can tell a lot about you<strong>. People who hug pillows and sleep or</strong> sleep surrounded by pillows often cherish their relationships with the important individuals in their lives, whether they’re friends, family, or personal relationships.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuobFdmbxus9SyqmagpZx6sbXLpaawq12staa6jK2fnrFdqLmmsc9maGlsZGV%2BcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jack-eichel-girlfriend-know-all-about-erin-besil.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jack Eichel's girlfriend?
