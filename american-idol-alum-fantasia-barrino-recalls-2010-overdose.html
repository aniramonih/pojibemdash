The nurse subsequently told Barrino: “You see that young lady? She’s strong. She’s a blessing. Don’t you come back in here no more. You fight.”</p><p>After Barrino <a href=#>left the hospital</a>, she vowed to herself that she would “never do that again” as she felt like she had a “purpose.”</p><p>“I’m going to speak into every young person’s life and tell them, ‘Don’t you dare give up,’” the <a href=#>Color Purple</a> actress shared with the outlet. “I don’t care if it gets ugly. I don’t care if there’s storms. I realized I have the spirit of an eagle.

They just see the glitz and the glamor, and they feel like life is so perfect, but we’re human and we go through things.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fantasia-Barrino-Recalls-2010-Overdose-2.jpg><p>Barrino rose to stardom after winning season 3 of American Idol in 2004.
