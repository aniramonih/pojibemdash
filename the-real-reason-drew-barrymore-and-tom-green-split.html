I don't really tend to talk about it that much comfortably [or] publicly. All of that was part of that sort of crazy, whirlwind of a time." He continued, "I haven't talked to her in many, many years. I'm glad she's doing great. I'm really happy that she's doing good."</p><p>Barrymore never spoke openly about the marriage — and neither had Green after Oprah for that matter — until September 2020.
