Despite trying many different wedding dress styles, it was the first wedding dress <a class=hm-link href=#>Vicky</a> tried that won her heart. Luxury dressmaker Kate exclusively told <strong></strong> how she helped the TV star get a beautiful look.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e0jzEcvQ-f9 data-wc=90>She told us: "It was an absolute pleasure to work with <a class=hm-link href=#>Vicky on creating her wedding dress</a>. We had so much fun trying on lots of different styles from the collection, but it was the first outfit Vicky tried that ultimately was the one. The Okotan corset is draped in the most wonderful Italian silk crepe and I just knew that the corset and matching draped skirt with the high leg split would look incredible on her. It’s such a beautiful style that really shows off and celebrates your body.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Michelle Keegan is a total bombshell in £24 cut-out wedding guest dress" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d505f9cae8ac-michelle-keegan-strapless-dress.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Michelle Keegan is a total bombshell in £24 cut-out wedding guest dress" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Michelle Keegan is a total bombshell in £24 cut-out wedding guest dress</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Strictly's John Whaite's secret engagement and 'country bumpkin' wedding plans" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/284026e91b3f-john-whaite-black-outfit.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Strictly's John Whaite's secret engagement and 'country bumpkin' wedding plans" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Strictly's John Whaite's secret engagement and 'country bumpkin' wedding plans</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=edMIl11WET data-wc=116>"Vicky added the Peter cape to the look which we made bespoke to attach around the drapes of the arms, so the outfit all stayed off the shoulder. It was perfect! The Peter cape is made from fine gauge spotty tulle and trimmed with the most exquisite embroidery. Then, all that was needed was a simple plain tulle veil and we decided on a length that was the same as the cape so they all lined up beautifully together. Vicky looked sensational on her wedding day and it was a joy to work with her on such a special outfit. We also whipped out one of our beautiful sage green Sister dresses for her sister too!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54b3aeeabf88-jonny-owen-vicky-mcclure-birthday-tribute.jpg><p id=e7Fp0-9VoD4 data-wc=36>Also on hand to ensure the day went smoothly was Vicky’s trusted hairdresser and close friend Louis Byrne. As the evening unfolded, the celebrity stylist and hairdresser was there to assist with the bride’s second look.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fbdcc4038a91-vicky-mcclure-wedding.jpg><p id=eIOY3SPEfz data-wc=33>He told us: "After the first dance the veil came out, the cape came off and the hair went up into a messy bun ready to dance the night away and we did!"</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Get Vicky McClure's wedding hair look</h3><p id=eodRr6hRfC>Celebrity and hairstylist Louis Byrne revealed the secret behind achieving Vicky McClure’s bridal hairstyle on the morning of her big day and the preparations it took. Brides, take inspiration!&nbsp;</p><p id=eZEommV9vGI>He told <strong></strong>: "We've been transitioning Vicky's hair from short to long for a while now, working on the condition and really caring for it, this has absolutely enhanced the natural curl along with the layered shag haircut. We did a trial a few days before and spoke about how we wanted the hair to feel, this is key! Feeling over looks! &nbsp;</p><p id=eQvbXbSXzfx>"Vicky wanted to feel like her, this may sound obvious but often brides get carried away and end up feeling alien &nbsp;in their own look, so we worked out veil positioning and the overall feel.</p><p id=eMl4hYq1n0F>"This started with texture working with Vicky's natural curl I used metal detox cream and oil and curl expression caring water mist by L'Oréal Professionnel and we let the hair air dry, so zero heat. Using some flat clips to enhance and define the natural curl formation.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebfioekor5>"Romantic and feminine were the key feeling, pinning half back but keeping it feeling loose and face framing. Personal detailing was added with the two small crosses to the back."</p><p id=eTHRasIklut data-wc=93>In contrast to the short crop she sports in her role as AC-12’s no-nonsense police officer, Vicky wore her hair softly waved in a half-updo thanks to Louis, who tells us: "From start to finish it was love, joy and laughter. We always have a great time together, that’s why it works, the music is always on, we take pics and videos but nothing retouched or staged, always real. Standing in front of the mirror doing the final touches to the look was a very special moment… It really was an incredible wedding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92ed75a86045-line-of-duty.jpg><p id=eD5qV-ZGDlu data-wc=111>Opening up about helping the star prepare, Louis revealed how it was "non stop laughter and love" on the wedding morning. He said: "The getting ready part is so important I made a schedule and call sheet so it ran like clockwork. The tunes were on, the tea was flowing and it was non stop laughter and love. There are always moments of high energy, like when the look comes together, when the makeup is done, when the dress goes on, that was very special. Vicky's dress was so beautiful, what a lady! For me its when the veil goes on, that's when you feel all the emotion so very special."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Prince Harry issued warning to Meghan Markle following royal wedding" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b57fbb31c0c3-harry-meghan-steps-sydney.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Prince Harry issued warning to Meghan Markle following royal wedding" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Prince Harry issued warning to Meghan Markle following royal wedding</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="GMA's Robin Roberts' wedding month has a special meaning behind it – and it's happening soon" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fd99a4ae3cce-robin-roberts-wearing-white.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="GMA's Robin Roberts' wedding month has a special meaning behind it – and it's happening soon" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>GMA's Robin Roberts' wedding month has a special meaning behind it – and it's happening soon</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eZnP1w3QAga data-wc=61>It was an incredibly touching moment for Louis who has a close friendship with the star.
