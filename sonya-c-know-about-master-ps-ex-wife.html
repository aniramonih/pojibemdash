She is best known as Master P’s ex-wife. The couple married in 1989 and have seven children together, including Tytyana.</p><p>They made headlines in 2013 when Sonya C filed for divorce, sparking a rumored bitter custody battle over financial assets. According to Master P, the couple settled their differences privately in 2016, but nothing ever went to court.</p><h2>Sonya C Early Life</h2><p><strong>Sonya C</strong> <strong>was raised in the United States by her African-American parents,</strong> about whom little is known because she respects their privacy; some of her fans believe her father was a mailman and her mother was a maid.<br>Most people believe she is an only child because she hasn’t mentioned her siblings.</p><h2>Why did Master P and Sonya divorce?</h2><p>The couple married for the first time in 1989 and were married for over 20 years. However, the couple made headlines in 2013 when Sonya C filed for divorce, resulting in a reportedly bitter financial dispute.</p><p>According to TMZ at the time, the estranged wife demanded a $67 million divorce settlement, claiming she was entitled to a portion of the rapper’s fortune. Miller’s alleged drug and alcohol use is said to have contributed to the couple’s breakup. According to sources, Master P believed it was having a negative impact on their children.</p><p>“I take great care of all of my kids, all of their needs are met in abundance,”</p><p>The rapper said in a public statement addressing their divorce in 2014.</p><p>I’m from the ghetto, I changed my life, but she refused to grow with me, so we’re not together.”</p><p>According to Master P, the couple eventually settled their differences privately in 2016, but nothing ever went to court. Five years later, the artist filed paperwork requesting that a judge declare him legally single. This was allegedly confirmed in May 2022, just weeks before his daughter Tytyana’s tragic death.</p><p>On The Wendy Williams Show, Master P discussed their split, saying, “In a relationship, things happen.”<br>People grow together and apart.</p><p>“She was definitely present. We haven’t had a relationship in seven years… I’m not upset with her. “I adore her.”</p><h2>Sonya C Career As A Rapper</h2><p><strong>Sonya C</strong> worked various jobs for five years to support herself and to pay for the recording of her songs.<br>Her rapping career began in 1993, with the release of her debut album “Married to the Mob”; three of the album’s songs received some attention: “Gankers,” “No Credit,” and “Life Ain’t Nothing But A Game.”</p><p>Sonya’s second album, “True to the Game,” was released in 1997, and her third album, “Da Crime Family,” was released in 1999; she only released one more album before retiring from the rap industry, “The Best of TRU,” in 2005.</p><h2>How Many Children Do Master P And Sonya C Have?</h2><p><strong>Master P</strong> has nine children in total, seven of which he shares with his ex-wife Sonya. After failing to appear for a custody hearing in 2014, he lost custody of four of his youngest children to Miller. He was also ordered to pay Miller’s legal fees of $75,000 in addition.</p><h2>Children</h2><ul><li>Percy “Romeo” Miller (1989)</li><li>Vercy Miller “Young V” (1991)</li><li>Tytyana Miller (1992 – 2022)</li><li>Inty Miller (1993)</li><li>Itali Miller (1999)</li><li>Hercy Miller (2002)</li><li>Mercy Miller (2005)</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqqKaplnqkecqnprBlkZe8tsCMppisrJWnerG%2FjJ6vZq%2BZm7Jw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ski-mask-the-slump-god-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Ski Mask the Slump God Net Worth</span></a>
