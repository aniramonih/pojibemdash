Though they weren’t sure if Muñoz had died from an overdose accident, suicide, or murder, prosecutors thought her death was suspicious.</p><p>Mata received calls shortly after Muñoz passed away from friends, family, and, strangely enough, Pellot’s old and current coworkers.</p><p>They informed him that Muñoz was requesting a divorce and that Pellot had been involved in an affair.</p><p>Dr. Huntsinger, an anesthesiologist, and Pellot’s previous supervisor encouraged Mata to do a toxicological exam and provided him with a list of medications to look for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Maria-Munoz-Death-1.jpg><p>When Muñoz’s toxicology reports were returned about four months after her death, they showed that she had seven distinct medicines in her blood, most of which were used during surgery and one of which could only be given via an IV.</p><p>It was the proof that the police were required to detain Joel Pellot and accuse him of killing Maria Muñoz.</p><p>The prosecution stated that they think Pellot might have injected Muñoz with the additional medicines after secretly adding some sedatives to her preferred beverage, coffee.</p><p>Chief prosecutor Garza Gutierrez said on “48 Hours” that “I think he waited until she was dead to call 911 to make sure that no one can bring her back.”</p><h2>Husband Joel Pellot Charged With Murder</h2><p>Lead investigator Sergeant Luis Mata arrived at the scene to find Pellot drenched in perspiration and unresponsive to queries.</p><p>After getting into a patrol car, Pellot was driven to the police station to be interviewed.</p><p>Pellot informed Mata during this interview that he was moving out of his and Muñoz’s house to live with a girlfriend, and that evening he had a “heart-to-heart” talk about their marriage with Maria.</p><p>Janet and Joel Pellot were also involved in a romantic liaison. According to reports, Pellot informed Janet that he intended to dissolve his union with Maria Muñoz.</p><p>But the most convincing proof was that propofol was present in Maria’s body.</p><p>Joel claims that propofol is only ever used in operating rooms and is never utilized as a recreational drug.</p><p>This is because patients will undoubtedly cease breathing and require oxygen from an external source. Pellot was determined to be Maria’s most likely source of propofol.</p><p>After pretty compelling arguments from both sides, the trial came to an end on March 30, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Maria-Munoz.jpg><p>Joel Pellot was found guilty of both the murder of his spouse and the falsification of evidence.</p><p>Maria’s sister felt pressured by Pellot to consent to a cremation. It was what Maria had always wanted, he said.</p><p>Pellot believed that the journals and stories of Maria Muñoz’s marital troubles and mental anguish were very helpful.</p><p>On December 16, 2023, at 10 p.m. ET, CBS 48 Hours will feature an episode titled “The Journals of Maria Muñoz.”</p><p>By looking through her notebooks, the episode investigates Maria Muñoz’s life and her unexplained death.</p><p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Breckie Hill Kevin Gates Story Reddit Update: Leaked Video And Scandal</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jpyZrGVkbXqpu9Srqmalkae2onnMrqWosl2ZsqLAx2aYp5xdpK%2BqwNSaqbJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brown-girl-jane-cbd-fragrance.html><span>←</span><span>Brown Girl Jane Fragrance Launch</span></a>
