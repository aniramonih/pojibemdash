Not the romantic type of love‚Ä¶good heavens, no! I‚Äôm Norwegian! But I have loved so many of the fathers who sent their kiddos to CBCC. They were like younger brothers to me. They were like sons. Oh, how we would laugh and banter back and forth and back again. I loved the mothers of my students‚Ä¶but I always felt closer to the dads. The dads seemed to have more time to shoot the breeze, or lighten the mood of the day. Maybe because I didn‚Äôt have daughters, I knew how to relate to the boys‚Ä¶who knows. Ryan McNeice was a dad I loved. He was witty, intelligent, driven, cool, fun, honest. We shared a few jokes about blood sucking lawyers and tangerine speedos. It was harmless. It was fun. One day someone brought a snake to CBCC for show and tell. As he approached the snake to get a better look, I called out, ‚ÄúNot too close, Ryan. They eat their own!‚Äù Ryan, a well-loved local attorney laughed a hearty laugh. A few days later he brought me a book, ‚ÄúHow to Take Care of Your Pet Snake.‚Äù I still have that book. My heart goes out to Sarah, Olivia, Elliot. To all the CBCC men I have loved‚Ä¶you know who you are ..hug your families. Life is too short.üíî</p><p>Well, unfortunately, we do not have any reliable information on his cause of death at this moment.
