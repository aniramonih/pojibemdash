Martin Hewitt was born on February 19th 1958, in San Jose, California.&nbsp;He is the second-oldest of six children of Peter Hewitt and Heather Hewitt.&nbsp;Peter Hewitt is a retired owner of a manufacturing company.&nbsp;Hewitt’s earliest years included California, England, Belgium and Michigan.</p><p>When Hewitt is filming Crime Lords in South Africa in 1989, Hewitt met German airline attendant Kerstin Gneiting. He got married in 1990.&nbsp;The couple divorced in the year 2015.&nbsp;Their two children include daughters Guinevere as well as son Cailean.</p><p>Hewitt has confirmed that he and Shields were never romantically involved in real life, stating that they “became good friends, but we’re not close.” Shields later vouched for this in her 2014 memoir, There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me. “Martin and I got along well and enjoyed working with one another. We neither fell in love nor hated each other…All we were required to do was convince people we were in love. This approach freed us both up to become actual friends.”</p><p>Hewitt garnered mostly neutral reviews for his portrayal of David Axelrod. Variety commented that “Since he’s center stage most of the time, it’s fortunate that newcomer Martin Hewitt registers so strongly. Zeffirelli has dressed and photographed his find almost in the style of some of his mentor Luchino Visconti’s neo-realist heroes, with two-day beard growths and anachronistic Clark Gable undershirts.” Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Hewitt “has neither the resources nor the opportunity to convey much about how David’s mind works, even though this is what the story hinges on.” Nevertheless, Hewitt said, “I don’t care what anyone says; I am proud of that film.”</p><p align=justify>After the second of his films, Yellowbeard (1983), where he played the character’s son Graham Chapman, Hewitt spent the 1980s filming a few mediocre B films and directing occasionally TV special.&nbsp;Some of the films he was in in the 1980s were: April Fool, later to be named Killer Party (1986); The Falling (1987); and Two Moon Junction (1988).&nbsp;In the last film, he played Chad as the fiancee to Sherilyn Fenn’s character.&nbsp;Hewitt had previously collaborated alongside Fenn for Out Of Control (1985).&nbsp;Hewitt was also a straight-to-video producer in films, including Crime Lords (1991), Carnal Crimes (1991) and Night Rhythms (1992).&nbsp;He later quit the show business.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martin Hewitt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hewitt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Jose</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kerstin Gneiting</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cailean Hewitt, Guinevere Hewitt</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Martin Hewitt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
