Last year, she <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://thejasminebrand.com/2017/10/23/joseline-hernandez-motherhood-changed-my-life-no-drugs-no-alcohol-no-nothing/>recalled</a> being at “a place of stillness” when she was 37 weeks pregnant with her child. With the absence of drugs and alcohol, the Latina star said pregnancy taught her to be greater than she can imagine.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>“Motherhood changes you, it’s like everything is so clear,” she adds.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>A MOTHER AND A TEACHER</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>It was clear to Joseline from then on that Bonnie was going to be her priority. Her daughter is a big part of her life as a single mother and she delights in teaching her different things including Spanish. In July, she shared a video where they’re watching a Spanish program for children. In her caption, she writes in Spanish,</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>“Me and Bonnie Bella everyday.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Fans praised the star then for teaching her daughter to be bilingual. And it seems like Bonnie’s daily exposure to Spanish has paid off. Just recently, the toddler showcased how well-versed she is in the language in a video her mother shared.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>In the clip, Joseline asks her daughter questions in Spanish, and Bonnie responds. She answers questions about her name and age and even blows a kiss in the air when her mom asks her to. In the end, Bonnie gets a kiss from her proud mother for a job well done.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Fans delighted in the short clip and gushed over how cute and impressive Bonnie is. They also praised Joseline for teaching her little girl to be bilingual. One fan wrote,</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>“Most precious moment ever. She is so cute omg and brilliant and bilingual, and that’s amazing! Thank God Josline genes take over lol she is too cute tho. That’s a good mom making sure she knows two languages!”</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>CULTIVATING A PASSION FOR MUSIC</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>A lesson in Spanish isn’t the only thing Joseline has been giving her child. Last month, she shared a video of her daughter playing with the keyboard. It won’t come as a surprise if Bonnie develops a passion for music. Her father, Stevie J is a popular DJ and record producer.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Prior to that, Bonnie introduced her daughter to veteran singer Betty Wright. The three were photographed after spending a day together and making “only beautiful memories,” <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BoaIXDhBHdg/>according to Joseline</a>.</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Kehlani's Ethnicity: The Singer Has a Mixed Heritage That Includes Native Americans</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Faith Evans' Spouse: The Singer Remarried Twice after Biggie's Death</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Robert Blake's Daughter Didn't Speak about Herself for Years Following Family Tragedy & Only Visited Mom's Grave at 18</h2></a><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>TALES OF A SINGLE MOM</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Joseline has taken on the role of sole parent to Bonnie whose father has been absent from her life. In September, she <a class="ae -U" href=#>accused</a> Stevie J of being delinquent in paying child support and not visiting their daughter for months. She would later learn her ex <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.tmz.com/2018/07/18/faith-evans-stevie-j-apply-for-marriage-license-las-vegas/>secretly wed</a> Faith Evans in Las Vegas. Joseline <a class="ae -U" href=#>wasn’t too happy</a> about the news and even revealed that Stevie proposed to her just a few months earlier.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Despite Stevie's absence, Joseline and Bonnie appear to be doing just fine. They’ll be taking over Miami in their new reality show, “Joseline Takes Miami.” Fans can expect more of Bonnie’s lessons in Spanish and the bond she shares with her mother when the show premieres in WE TV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpocWloZ3qru9Keo6KmlWK1pr7NmqWdnapivbOtyKycnWWjpbKit8innmaroJa7b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joel-kinnaman-net-worth-156544.html><span>←</span><span>Joel Kinnaman Net Worth</span></a>
