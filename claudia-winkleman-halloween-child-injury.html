Her daughter Matilda, now 17, whom she shares with husband Kris Thykier, was eight years old when the witch costume she was wearing went up in flames after she brushed against a candle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/41de96956449-matilda-thykier.jpg><p id=eR7jRgTRdsG data-wc=55>Speaking to magazine, Claudia recalled the moment: "She 'went up' is the only way I can describe it – it was a spark and she screamed out for me. It was like those horrific birthday candles that you blow out and they come back. It was really fast. It was definitely life-changing for me."&nbsp;</p><p id=eqGBa-HiZAz data-wc=39>The mother added: "I was talking to someone and then I heard her shout and she was on fire. It feels like she was on fire for hours, but the surgeon said it was probably just seconds," she said.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Claudia Winkleman makes major change to her look and Strictly fans are stunned" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/856adc470535-claudia-winkleman-new-look.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Claudia Winkleman makes major change to her look and Strictly fans are stunned" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Claudia Winkleman makes major change to her look and Strictly fans are stunned</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to bewitch in a sustainable Halloween costume this year" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c7b4946d5b4c-bella-hadid-and-the-weeknd.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to bewitch in a sustainable Halloween costume this year" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to bewitch in a sustainable Halloween costume this year</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ejYKESCCM4i data-wc=36>The eight-year-old spent three weeks in hospital having suffered serious burns to her legs and the family's neighbour Jamie Poulton was left with second-degree burns after trying to put out the fire with his bare hands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f20d1e9bdd8-claudia-winkleman-husband.jpg><p id=eYBc82WaYxU data-wc=44>Jamie <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>told the Daily Mail</a>: &nbsp;"This material just keeps reigniting and re-burning. And it is sticky, so it melts on the skin. It doesn't cinder. It remains hot. It was horrific to be honest. I was trying to put it out with my hand.</p><p id=eJVRh6i6ZaD data-wc=68>He continued: "It was a warm night so I wasn't wearing a jacket. I was trying to roll her and pat her clothes. I was trying to rip the costume off her, which didn't really help because it just ripped and dropped back. It is very bad material. That stuff is terrible. The costumes are very, very cheap to buy. They are nylon and they just go up."</p><p id=eXLcYCp_s3r data-wc=59>The presenter has since shared the impact this traumatic experience has had on her mental health. Speaking on , the podcast she co-hosts with psychologist Professor Tanya Byron, the mother-of-two said: "You helped me with flashbacks. I had flashbacks of when my daughter had an accident and they come at you like a bull."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34517ce45b2c-halloween-trick-treat.jpg><p id=eWug-NEvXsK data-wc=23>"Like a tsunami, it’s so enormous you think you’re going to drown," she continued. "So you have to shove it to one side."</p><p id=e_umO3F2_di data-wc=68>Since the incident, Claudia has worked tirelessly to campaign for greater safety around the materials used to make Halloween costumes. The presenter successfully managed to get the British Royal Consortium to release voluntary guidelines that state that toys, the umbrella children's costumes come under, are not to be made from fabric that can burn any faster than 10mm per second. This was reduced significantly from 30mm per second.</p><p id=eQDVD3pUOjB data-wc=44>When this was enacted in 2017, Claudia said, "I’m pleased to hear about the new guidelines. But as they are only voluntary, they are only a first step...I sincerely hope the Government continues to push for these guidelines to be made a legal requirement."</p><h2 dir=ltr>A new safety warning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6f5b923421c-halloween-costumes-kids.jpg><p id=eGmrPZzV9Sjl data-wc=61>Now, nine years on from the accident, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has issued a health warning that aims to protect people from incidents like Claudia's. Shoppers have been told to only buy products that have been tested by members of the British Retail Consortium as they will more likely have stood up to high safety standards.</p><p id=eya3YCmva-xA data-wc=22>Items approved by the BRC will have a label sown into them, stating: "This garment has undergone additional safety testing for flammability".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28c2d5021cbe-halloween-costumes.jpg><p id=eYBAemFWLBCV data-wc=20>In addition, RoSPA pointed out that all elements of the costume such as wigs and face masks should be flame-retardant.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSQ_raF-_PBL data-wc=39>Claudia has kept her daughter Matilda out of the limelight along with her 20-year-old son, Jake. However, the campaigning she has done in light of the terrible ordeal her family suffered will undoubtedly keep many children safe this Halloween.</p><p id=e9zEtdufVjs data-wc=13><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly's Claudia Winkleman surprises in vampy dress of dreams – and wow</a></p><p id=e20mT6qvpio data-wc=25></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
