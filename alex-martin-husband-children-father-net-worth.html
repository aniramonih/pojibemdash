<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>Actress Whoopi Goldberg's daughter Alex Martin married thrice with the same man!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Daughter of <strong>Alvin Martin</strong>&nbsp;and comedienne and actress&nbsp;<strong>Whoopi Goldberg, Alex Martin </strong>is also<strong> </strong>an American actress appearing in small roles in films like <i>Sister Act 2</i> and <i>Call Me Claus</i>. Here are all the important details about Martin, which includes her bio, wiki, net worth, husband and married life, and so on.</p><h2>Bio of Alex Martin</h2><p>Alex Martin was born on May 9, 1973, in the United States of America as an Alexandrea Martin. She is the only daughter of <strong>Whoopi Goldberg </strong>and her father, <strong>Alvin Martin. </strong>Her father was the first husband of her mother and also a former soccer player. There are no further details about Martin's educational background and early life.</p><p>Alex started off her career as an actress, and now she is one of the most successful film producers. Recently in 2015, she started a TV program. <i>According to Alex</i>, she is also an executive producer of the shows. Similarly, in 2013, she also worked in the movie <i>Sensitive Men </i>which did pretty well in the box office.</p><p>Not to forget, in 2014, Alex and her family became the subjects of a reality television series co-produced by One Ho Productions and 44 Blue Productions.</p><p>Alex's age is 46 as of 2019. When it comes to her personal details, Martin is a very low key because there is no data on her body size, height, and weight on the internet. Just like Alex, <a href=#><strong>Jocelyn Howard</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Danny Kosarin</strong></a> are also a very prominent celebrity of the entertainment industry. &nbsp;</p><h2>Personal life: Husband & Children</h2><p>Unlike any other celebrities who get married multiple times with multiple partners, Alex is also married thrice however with the same man. Before getting married to <strong>Benard, Dean&nbsp;</strong>Martin had already given birth to her first daughter <strong>Amarah Skye.&nbsp;</strong>The father of the child is not known to this date.&nbsp;</p><p>There are no details on when Alex got married to Benard for the first time. However, their last marriage took place in Los Angeles. Before the duo's last wedding with Benard Dean, Alex dated <strong>Steve Jordan</strong> for six long years. The two spat in 2007, around four years before Alex again married Benard Dean.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/17/Capture%20(2)-1568718834564.jpg><p>Many of their fans assume, last marriage will probably last longer since they seem to have dealt with a majority of the issues that often strained their relationship. In the same way, there are no signs of a possible breakup shortly.&nbsp;</p><h3>Children&nbsp;</h3><p>From her marriage with Benard Dean, she has given birth to two children named<strong>&nbsp;Jerzey&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Mason</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/17/Capture%20(3)-1568719021916.jpg><p>Her eldest daughter, Amarah has already given birth to a daughter, <strong>Charlie Rose</strong>. So, Alex is already a grandmother of her first daughter's daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alex Martin's Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As said before, Alex is an actress as well as a producer. Being in the acting field for more than three decades has surely earned her <strong>$500 thousand</strong> to date.&nbsp; However, it is difficult to compare the success of Alex’s mother with Alex. Martin certainly has a successful career, but she has yet to reach the bar set by her mother.</p><p>Alex's hasn't revealed any details about her net worth yet. Assuming her net worth as per the success she has got might be around <strong>$3 million</strong>. Her successful husband further aids her assets. Just like the details about her net worth, there are also no details about her house and the cars she rides.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To read more celebrity biography visit- </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Marriedceleb</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpqjnrBdoq6zwMinZKGto5eur7CMnJ%2BipJSnsq95xZqroZ2iYrumwIywpqusmA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roseanne-cancelled-abc.html><span>←</span><span>ABC Cancels 'Roseanne' After Roseanne Barr's Racist Tweet</span></a>
