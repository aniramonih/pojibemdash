The late Naya Rivera was a single, divorced mom when she passed away. She and Ryan Dorsey had split a few years before her passing, but from the lack of gossip around their split, it seemed like it was pretty amicable between them and they happily co-parented their son Josey. Ryan seemed genuinely distraught with Naya’s passing in July. He gained full custody of Josey but, again, from the lack of gossip around everything, I’ve been assuming that he’s on good terms with Naya’s family and that everyone was committed to getting along for Josey.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Pierced body part</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
