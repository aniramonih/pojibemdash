To say it's been quite the week in the world of royal reporting would be an understatement.
One of the headlines flying around was that Prince William &#34;refused&#34; to see Prince Harry when he was in the UK this week, and that Harry would have been &#34;willing&#34; to patch things up with his big brother. But did Harry even extend that olive branch in the first place? It's arguable."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Harry was on home soil for around 25 hours, and his sole focus was seeing his father, King Charles. Under such time constraints, meeting with William too would have been tough. But there are other factors, beyond the logistical, that made a brotherly reunion this week a long shot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqn66ura%2FLrplnoJWhubC5wKCYs6Gemnuku8xop2ihnWK7sMCMrKyrqKKewKawjLCgpaSZlrpurc2dZKGZoqfG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-has-the-all-time-poker-money-winner-made.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Has The All-Time Poker Money Winner Made?</span></a>
