last man standing in the 2017 NFL Draft, a position that carried the unwanted “Mr.&nbsp;Irrelevant,” the stage was set and everyone was watching to see how he would end up in the NFL.&nbsp;Looking at the evolution of her career with Ole Miss, we wouldn’t be wrong if we described her as a little above average.&nbsp;However, now on the Denver Broncos roster, Kelly had the opportunity to become the star of his life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Profile of Chad Kelly</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kelly was born Chad Patrick Kelly on March 26, 1994 and grew up in Western New York.&nbsp;Her parents are Kevin Kelly and Charlene Cudzylo Kelly.&nbsp;His father, Kevin, who was a grocery store manager, was also the older brother of popular National Football League (NFL) quarterback Jim Kelly.&nbsp;After seeing his nephew take an interest in a sport in which he thrived, his uncle, Jim, who was still playing professional football for the Buffalo Bills, sought to impress young Kelly as a mentor.&nbsp;But Kelly had other ideas and her uncle had to give up because he noticed that Kelly was not following his instructions.</span></p><p><span>Chad Kelly first played football with the Red’s high school football team when his family moved to Pennsylvania following his father’s transfer to a Red Lion store, but he was soon dropped from the team. and had to return to western New York.</span></p><p><span>When he enrolled in high school at St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute in Tonawanda, New York, he joined the school’s football team.&nbsp;Thanks to his high school performances, Rivals.com—a network of websites focused on the performance of high school and college football teams (and basketball)—would position him among the top dual-threat quarterbacks in his class.&nbsp;For his junior and high school year, Kelly had 5,209 yards and 51 touchdowns and 2,050 yards and 29 touchdowns.&nbsp;He was also rated a “four star rookie” by the same website.</span></p><p><span>He graduated from high school in 2012 and went to Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina, as he had already committed to playing for the school’s football team.&nbsp;Having not played in his first year with the team, he appeared in just five games for the team in his second year.&nbsp;But in 2014, problems arose as he was dropped from the squad due to inappropriate conduct detrimental to the team.&nbsp;He left Clemson and went to East Mississippi Community College, where he led it to a record 12 wins without losing in his only season there.&nbsp;With this feat, the East Mississippi Lions won the 2015 NJCAA Football National Championship.</span></p><p><span>Her next port of call was the University of Mississippi (affectionately called Ole Miss).&nbsp;He played his first game with Ole’s Miss Rebels as a starting quarterback against UT Martin.&nbsp;He would go on to lead the Rebels to important victories over Alabama and Louisiana State, including a 2016 Sugar Bowl win over Oklahoma State.&nbsp;Due to his performance in the game, he was awarded the Sugar Bowl MVP.&nbsp;His next season was hampered by a torn ACL and lateral meniscus injury to his right knee, which he suffered in a game against Georgia Southern in November 2016.</span></p><p><span>For his professional football career, Chad KellyHe is currently playing in the NFL with the Denver Broncos after being selected in the seventh round of the 2017 NFL Draft as the final draft pick (253rd overall).&nbsp;This position automatically earns him the title of “Mr.&nbsp;Not important.”</span></p><h2><strong><span>Salary and net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Despite his haphazard career, Kelly is worth $2 million which he accrued as a result of the 4-year contract worth $2,464,270 he signed with his team – Denver Broncos.&nbsp;His annual salary is approximately $616,068.&nbsp;He has also started living the life that suits his net worth, as he recently slashed the cash to acquire a brand new Ford automobile for $54,000.</span></p><p><span>There is a feeling that this is just the beginning, his footballing potential has yet to be tapped.&nbsp;Once that’s done, it’ll only be natural to attract some great new deals that will skyrocket his net worth in record time.&nbsp;All you have to do is watch this space.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life – Is Chad Kelly married?&nbsp;Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Chad Kelly’s relationship life is skimpy.&nbsp;He is unmarried and currently not dating anyone (at least none that we know of).&nbsp;He’s probably trying to focus on his career and unleash the genius that we all know is locked away somewhere inside of him.&nbsp;There’s no relationship activity around him — no posts from any women on any of his social media accounts, no vacations with anyone — and so it’s safe to assume the Denver Broncos quarterback is currently single.</span></p><p><span>But it wasn’t always like that.&nbsp;Kelly has had at least one public relationship.&nbsp;He was in a relationship with Nicole Bell, a former Atlanta Falcons cheerleader in 2014. Bell is a model and she graduated from Georgia State University.&nbsp;Unlike Kelly, Bell has moved on and is currently dating Zac Hauther.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body Stats – Weight, Height, Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Broncos QB is athlete-sized and even bigger.&nbsp;He is 1.88m (6ft 2in) tall and his weight is proportioned at 224 lbs.&nbsp;His other body measurements and stats are not available.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other Facts About Chad Kelly</span></strong></h2><p><span>Chad Kelly has had scandals off the field.&nbsp;In 2015, he was allegedly fought at a bar in his hometown of Buffalo and punched the face of the bouncer he was arrested for.</span></p><p><span>He had a cousin – Hunter Kelly – the only son of his Hall of Fame uncle Jim Kelly.&nbsp;However, the boy died as a child of a congenital disease</span></p><p><span>His two years with Ole Miss Rebels were remarkable as he set 25 football records in this country.</span></p><p><span>He was the first quarterback in SEC history to average 309.1 passing yards per game in 22 games.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, he became one of three SEC quarterbacks (the others being Tim Couch in 1998 and Johnny Manziel in 2013) to throw for 4,000 yards in a season.</span></p><p><span>His invitation to attend the NFL Scouting Reunion in Indianapolis was withdrawn due to his off-field issues (although some argue that not inviting him was a mere public relations stunt).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibmJaxbrfEpaOyZZKevG6%2FwKWYq7FdnLazuMWroJ6mlGK1prXGoatmr5WetKnAjJumnbFdqMGiwNJmnZqbpKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-that-live-in-ohio.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Living in Ohio: Buckeye State Stars</span></a>
