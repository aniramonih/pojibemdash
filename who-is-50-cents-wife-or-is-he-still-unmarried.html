The American rapper and actor has, however, dated several women over the years and is currently in a relationship with Jamira Haines aka Cuban Link.</strong></p><p>50 Cent whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III became popular for his streetwise raps How We Do, Candy Shop, and Disco Inferno. He is also celebrated for his Get Rich or Die Tryin‘ album, which was a huge commercial success. Moreover, besides his professional career, 50 Cent’s love life which at the moment revolves around Jamira has been systematically followed.</p><h2><strong>50 Cent is Not Married and Does Not Have a Wife</strong></h2><p>50 Cent is not married but has been romantically involved with many women most of who have a career in the American entertainment industry. The rapper has been named one of the top American celebrities with the longest list of girlfriends. He is also a father of two children whom he had with two of the women he dated.</p><h2><strong>50 Cent and Jamira ‘Cuban Link’ Haines Have Been Together Since 2019</strong></h2><p>Apart from his thriving music career, fans seem to be interested in 50 Cent’s dating history. Jamira is a model and Instagram influencer and is 26 years old. She is also a fitness trainer and businesswoman who runs her own brand, Cuban Fit. According to her Instagram bio, Haines is also an aspiring corporate lawyer.</p><p>The couple reportedly started dating in 2019 after they met at the Premier of 50 Cent’s show “Power” and has remained together ever since then. The public only knew about their relationship after they both officially announced it on Instagram. Jamira is the most recent woman to be added to Cent’s list of girlfriends and they seem to be happy and comfortable with each other.</p><p>In 2022, Jamira got embroiled in a longstanding feud 50 Cent had with American rapper, The Game. The two rap stars have been at loggerheads since 2005 when 50 Cent’s song The Massacre was pushed back in order to give The Game’s debut album more importance, given that they both were then in the same rap group, G-Unit.</p><p>Fast forward to March 2022, The Game, allegedly in a bid to get back at 50 Cent, outed Jamira for having DMed him. “Oh’ n tell ya girl stay out of my DM’s… if she don’t want her man overweight, fat as f***…”, The Game ridiculed. He also reported that Jamira had sent him her topless photos alongside her phone number with the caption “video girl?? Keep in mind.”</p><h2><strong>All The Women 50 Cent Has Dated in the Past</strong></h2><h3><strong>Shaniqua Tompkins</strong></h3><p>50 Cent’s first known relationship was with Shaniqua Tompkins and it lasted from 1994 to 1998. In the course of their relationship, Shaniqua gave birth to their son Marquise Jackson. The two reportedly began to have issues after 50 Cent allegedly assaulted her physically. They eventually fell out over money, child support, and housing.</p><p>In 2009, Tompkins sued Jackson for $50 million on the account that he promised to take care of her for life. However, the suit was dismissed by a judge by tagging it “an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour.” Ever since then, Shaniqua and 50 have been known for constantly throwing shades at each other on social media and exchanging mean words.</p><h3><strong>Meagan Good</strong></h3><p>Cent got into another public relationship in 2002 with Meagan Good, an American actress known for her role as Mya in the 2012 romantic drama Think Like A Man. Details of their relationship and what led to their breakup are not publicly available.

Meanwhile, Meagan Good later married (and divorced) American Preacher DeVon Franklin.</p><h3><strong>Vivica A. Fox</strong></h3><p>Vivica A.

After the movie, they started dating, but the relationship lasted just for a while as they would split in 2006.

To date, neither party confirmed their romance nor addressed the speculations.</p><h3><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></h3><p>The rap boss and Chelsea Handler, an American comedian and actress, dated sometime in 2010.

The couple had off and on again relationship between 2007 and 2012. While they were together, they were the envy of many given their constant public display of affection on social media.</p><p>They also worked together on several projects and attained several feats.
