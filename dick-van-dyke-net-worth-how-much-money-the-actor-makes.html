He’s a generous man who feels fortunate to be in the position he’s in today,” a friend of the star told </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a><span> in April 2021. “It’s not about publicity or making himself feel good. He genuinely wants to help.”</span></p><p><span>Dick showed off his age-defying dance skills in 2018’s </span><a href=#><i><span>Mary Poppins Returns</span></i></a><span>. In <a href=#>recent years</a>, he voiced a character in the Showtime series </span><i><span>Kidding</span></i><span> and appeared in </span><i><span>Buttons: A Christmas Tale</span></i><span>.
