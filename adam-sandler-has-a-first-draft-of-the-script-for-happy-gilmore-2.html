Christopher McDonald, who played Shooter McGavin, was on a Cleveland sports radio show last week. During his interview, he “let it slip” that a sequel to the 1996 movie is in the works. Apparently Adam Sandler, who co-wrote the first movie, showed him the first draft of a potential sequel, which he said was “awesome” and declared that the “fans demand it.” When the price is right (bitch), I guess everything old continues to be new again.</p><p>It sounds like Adam Sandler might be teeing up a sequel to his famed 1996 golf comedy “Happy Gilmore,” at least according to actor Christopher McDonald. McDonald, who played Shooter McGavin – the notorious arch nemesis of Sandler’s character Happy Gilmore – teased the possibility of a “Happy Gilmore 2” during an interview on Friday’s episode of “Audacy’s 92.3 The Fan” radio show.</p><p>“I saw Adam about two weeks ago… And he shows me the first draft of ‘Happy Gilmore 2,’” McDonald said, referring to a script he said that Sandler showed him.</p><p>He joked that the hosts he was speaking with may want to “cut that out” of the radio show because, he said, “I don’t wanna be a liar, but he did show me that, and I thought, ‘Well, that would be awesome.’ So, it’s in the works. Fans demand it, dammit!”</p><p>He later added that when he saw the script, he said he was “very, very pleased.” CNN had reached out to representatives for McDonald and Sandler for comment.</p><p>Sandler co-wrote “Happy Gilmore” and it became one of his most popular films. It follows Happy Gilmore (Sandler), a not-so-mild-mannered wannabe hockey player who discovers that he’s an exceptionally talented golfer with a slapshot-style swing.</p><p>He joins a golf tournament to try to win some money in an attempt to help save his grandmother’s house that she’s on the verge of losing. Gilmore goes on to become a golf legend, but his outrageous temperament and untraditional style catches the ire of golf pro Shooter McGavin (McDonald).</p><p><a href=#>[From CNN]</a></p><p>Sigh. “We need a Happy Gilmore 2,” said no one ever. Look, I was in 6th grade when the original movie came out and sure, I loved the crap outta it at the time. That said, I haven’t seen it in 25ish years. I have no idea if it holds up, but I bet it doesn’t! Even if they did a version adjusted for 2024 social inflation, I still don’t know if I’d have any interest in seeing it. It’s kinda fun that McDonald may have spilled the beans without permission, though. I wonder if he actually did or if Sandler let him say something to put feelers out for some free publicity. Speaking of, Adam Sandler is a talented, funny person who was <a href=#>2023’s highest paid actor</a>. There’s no way he couldn’t come up with a totally “new” movie while still using his familiar old format and same cast of funny friends. But don’t mind me. I’m just a super nostalgic gal, screaming into the void, begging for new franchises. <a href=#>We’ve had enough, (bitch).</a></p><p><a id=ekFSna2jSCRSMo_31oBSog class=gie-single href=# rel=noopener>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/avalon-0518631774.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/avalon-0518631741.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos credit: Universal Studios/Avalon, Xavier Collin / Image Press Agency / Avalon, IMAGO/Clemens Niehaus / Avalon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcW5jboBxe8CdmKaXo5a7pbjEq5ahmaOUrqCyyKuqrZeUp66nwL6onZismJqstK%2FRoqetl5akv6C0wKmnspeXnrmuu9Gelmtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abdel-mawgoud-ahmad-el-habashy.html><span>←</span><span>Abdel Mawgoud Ahmad El Habashy</span></a>
