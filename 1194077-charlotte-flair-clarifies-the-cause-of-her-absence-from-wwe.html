In a series of Tweets, Flair described her struggles with a silicone infection. Flair explained how, in 2018, a leak in one of her implants caused a severe case of silicone poisoning. Though that’s not the cause of Flair’s current absence, Flair said she’s having cosmetic surgery to fix an issue caused by a previous procedure. “This time, I’m going with an option that I believe will fix the issue [for a] long time, even though the recovery time is a little longer than I would like,” wrote Flair.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m going to save the history of my boobs for a different bedtime story, so:</p><p>Picture it. Charlotte, North Carolina, 2018. A young queen, shortly after a career defining Wrestlemania victory, finds herself sicker than sick at her brother’s house.</p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A trip to the doctor tells us the likely culprit is silicone poisoning, and that my implant had been leaking for quite some time. It was one of the worse cases the doctor had seen.</p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>At that time, I had a few options to fix the issue. Each option had a specific recovery time. I love this job more than anything, so I picked the option that allowed me to return the soonest. That was the choice I made.</p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fast forward to a few months ago. Something felt off, so I went back to the doctor. Same issue again.</p><p>This time, I’m going with an option that I believe will solve the issue long time, even though the recovery period is a little longer than I would like.</p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>To clarify: I do not have silicone poisoning this time. The surgery is cosmetic to fix an issue from a prior surgery</p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p>Flair explained that she wanted to clear the air about her history with the silicone poisoning.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You’re absolutely right; I do not owe anyone a thing. But I will not allow people to think I’m somehow ashamed of it for even a second longer. <a href=#>https://t.co/lOy3gPZz0a</a></p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p>Flair vowed to come back better than ever.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ll be back when I’m ready. The body will be rested, and the mind still focused on legacy. Focused on this job. Focused on being better. Always being better.</p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p>Lastly, Flair said that body shaming has to stop.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I appreciate this, but I feel fine. I’m not upset or angry, but enough is enough. The body shaming in general (not just me) has been allowed to go on for far too long. <a href=#>https://t.co/OsNQNAxFL2</a></p><p>— Charlotte Flair (@MsCharlotteWWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2020</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBya2lvZ2Kwqa3RpaatrJVis62tyKtknKSRp7antcSsZK2glWKwosHSnmSonl2dsrN5wJuqnqaTmnqnvs6mZLCvlQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-boiled-peanuts-go-bad-html.html><span>←</span><span>Can boiled peanuts go bad?</span></a>
