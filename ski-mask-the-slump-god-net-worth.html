During one in Los Angeles in 2017, he was pushed off the stage and subsequently assaulted by an associate of rapper <a href=# title="Rob Stone Net Worth">Rob Stone</a>; the attack was reportedly prompted by an ongoing feud between the two rappers. The following year, during a concert in Austin, Texas in August, Goulbourne asked the crowd for a moment of silence in honor of his late friend XXXTentacion. After an audience member heckled him, he threatened the audience member and ordered the rest of the audience to "fuck his ass up." This led to a big brawl, during which Goulbourne played XXXTentacion's song "Look at Me."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Golbourne resides in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2018, he was rocked by the murder of his close friend XXXTentacion, and in late 2019 was dealt a further blow with the passing of his other close rapper friend, Juice Wrld, from an opioid-induced seizure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6i4qnnMmqqkZaSdsm6%2Fy66kqWWXpLFuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./siwa-presents-pop-groups-xomg-pop-live-2024-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Siwa Presents Pop Groups XOMG POP!
