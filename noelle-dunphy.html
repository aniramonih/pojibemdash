About Rudy Giuliani Former Employee Noelle Dunphy</strong></h2><p>Noelle Dunphy (age: 43, born in November 1979) is an American author, consultant, and former associate of veteran politician Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>The year 2023 marked a significant turning point for Noelle as she stepped into the spotlight by leveling accusations of sexual harassment against Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>These allegations culminated in a legal lawsuit seeking a substantial sum of money in damages.</p><p>The lawsuit encompassed a disturbing array of claims against the lawyer known for his support of President Trump.</p><p><img decoding=async title="noelle dunphy " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/noelle-dunphy-wikipedia.webp alt="noelle dunphy wikipedia" width=500 height=404 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Allegations ranged from erratic behavior while under the influence of alcohol to non-consensual exposure of himself, along with demands for sexual favors and the utterance of various sexist and racist remarks.</p><p>In response, Giuliani vehemently denied all accusations, launching a counterattack against Dunphy by attempting to discredit her. He urged the court to strike certain sections of the lawsuit and to impose sanctions on both Dunphy and her legal representative.</p><p>However, as of August 2023, Dunphy and her lawyer have produced transcripts that seem to confirm Rudy Giuliani’s utterance of the very statements he had previously denied making.</p><p>The language in the transcripts is relatively crude and objectionable. It confirms that Giuliani used to call Noelle “sugar tits”; he also made comments about actor Matt Damon and called him “fag”.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Noelle Dunphy with Rudy Giuliani" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Noelle-Dunphy-with-Rudy-Giuliani.webp alt="Noelle Dunphy with Rudy Giuliani" width=500 height=381 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>What Happened Between Noelle Dunphy & Rudy Giuliani?</strong></h2><p>In a federal lawsuit filed in Manhattan, the 44-year-old individual alleges that over a span of two years, she experienced consistent sexual harassment from her prominent former employer.</p><p>This employer, whose law license was suspended subsequent to his involvement in his client’s post2020 election activities, is now facing serious accusations.</p><p>The lawsuit reveals distressing claims that the individual was repeatedly subjected to unwarranted demands for oral sex by Giuliani, often occurring during phone calls where Trump was on speakerphone.</p><p>Additionally, the individual asserts that she was coerced into providing false information to the FBI during their investigation of Giuliani.</p><p>During her employment which coincided with the final two years of Trump’s administration, the individual claims that she was compelled to maintain secrecy about the situation due to Giuliani’s ongoing divorce proceedings with his longtime wife, Judith.</p><p>Allegedly, she was required to work off-the-books, with Giuliani explaining that her salary would be deferred and her employment kept confidential until his divorce was finalized, all in an effort to avoid potential retaliation from his former spouse.</p><p>Fast forward to the present day, more than two years later, the individual contends that she has not received any of her promised $1 million salary. Consequently, she is seeking $10 million in damages for various legal claims, including the alleged $2 million owed in back wages.</p><p>The intention to sue was initially declared in January, prompting Giuliani, now 78 years old, to demand a criminal complaint.</p><p>Subsequently, the lawsuit was officially filed on May 15th, adding to the legal challenges Giuliani has recently faced, including his avoidance of jail time for failing to pay his ex-partner $260,000 in alimony.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Rudy Giuliani say about Matt Damon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rudy-Giuliani-say-about-Matt-Damon.webp alt="Rudy Giuliani say about Matt Damon" width=550 height=321 sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Recently Released Transcripts&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In August 2023, Noelle Dunphy’s lawyer presented transcripts that made shocking revelations. The transcript basically revolves around a conversation that happened between Rudy and Dunphy, but the language used in the conversation is very objectionable.</p><p>In the said conversation, Giuliani made comments about Jewish men. He even targeted Hollywood’s beloved actor Matt Damon saying:</p><p>“Matt Damon is a f – g. Damon is also 5’2, eyes are blue. Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo.”</p><p>Then there was a long s*xual conversation between Noelle and Giuliani where the latter called the former “sugar tits.”</p><p><img decoding=async title="Rudy Giuliani Ex Girlfriend Noelle Dunphy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rudy-Giuliani-Ex-Girlfriend-Noelle-Dunphy.webp alt="Rudy Giuliani Ex Girlfriend Noelle Dunphy" width=400 height=478 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Noelle Dunphy’s Parents & Early Life</strong></h2><p>In November 1979, Noelle Dunphy (age 43) was born in New York, United States.
