The purpose? Probably just to frolic on the beach for the paparazzi. This couple is rivaling Heidi and Spencer for cheesy, posed photo ops. Paris always has her obnoxious, “I think I’m sooooo attractive” pose/face going on. Which is funny, because nothing makes her look less attractive than when she does that.</p><p>Fame noted that “Paris’s beautiful blue bikini and wrap are the same color as the crystal clear azure Pacific Ocean. Paris and Doug are both very affectionate and touchy feely towards one another!” I wonder what she had to do to get that great line from the photogs? I’m surprised they didn’t compare it to the crystal blue of her colored contacts.</p><p>I think she looks like crap, but that’s mostly because of her personality. I guess Paris’ body is fine. But it’s hard to separate such a crappy person from her body. Well, guys do it. That’s how she manages to get a boyfriend. But I’m just not capable. I see Paris and I feel itchy and uncomfortable, like her myriad diseases might actually crawl through the screen.</p><p>On that note, here are some lovely photos!
